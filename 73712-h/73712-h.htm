</div>

<p>Having obtained access to some new authorities on
Bosnian history, I have thought it desirable to make
some additions to my ‘Historical Review’ in the present
Edition. I was the more anxious to do this as the
brevity with which I had expressed my views on the
most important aspect of Bosnian history—its connection,
namely, with the early history of Western Protestantism—has
led in some quarters to strange misconception. In
setting my conclusions on this head in, I trust, a clearer
light, I have been greatly aided by the recent appearance
of Herr Jireček’s <i>Geschichte der Bulgaren</i>, which contains
some valuable data from South-Sclavonic sources touching
the tenets and Church government of the Bogomiles, and
their missionary triumphs in Italy and Provence.</p>

<p>I have also added a few considerations on the present
state of Bosnia, the malign and artificial character of
the Osmanlì government in that province, and the reforms
which it were most desirable that an united Europe
should enforce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span></p>

<p>In doing so—though I, for one, was never so sanguine
as to imagine that the agreement of the great Powers was
anything else than a hollow pretence—I had found it
convenient to assume that the Conference was prepared
to speak to Turkey in the only language to which she was
capable of listening. As I write, however, the divisions
of Christendom, and, more than all, the anti-Sclavonic
jealousies of Austria-Hungary, have baffled the efforts of
diplomacy; and, after womanish expostulation and pitiable
huckstering, the representatives of Europe have been
shown the door by the Sick Man. The two alternatives
apparently left to us are, to England at least, equally pernicious
and equally shameful—a Russo-Turkish war, or
a new cycle of tyranny, agitation, and revolt, ending
where it began, and involving the solution, it may be,
of graver questions, than the fate of one Empire.</p>

<p>The tour described in this book was not in the slightest
degree due to the Insurrection in Bosnia and the Herzegovina.
It was planned before the outbreak, and was first
suggested by the interest which previous visits to other
South-Sclavonic lands had led me to take in the branch of
that race still under the Sultan’s dominion, and owing to a
special curiosity to see a race of Sclavonic Mahometans.
My desire of visiting Bosnia was further whetted by a
day spent a few years ago beyond the Bosnian border,
and by the interesting problems suggested by the history
and present state of Illyria. While I and my brother,
Lewis Evans, who accompanied me throughout, were preparing
for our journey, the Insurrection in the Herzegovina
broke out, so that it was undertaken rather in spite
of than by reason of that event. During our walk through
Bosnia that country also burst into insurrection; and as
we heard many accounts from trustworthy sources as
to the origin of the outbreak, both in Bosnia and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
Herzegovina, I have ventured to give some particulars
in the story of our itinerary.</p>

<p>We were armed with an autograph letter from the
Vali Pashà, or Governor-General of Bosnia and Commander-in-Chief
of the Turkish forces, and owing to this
were able to accomplish our tour without serious molestation,
though it must be confessed that we underwent some
risks. With a few short breaks we made our way through
the country on foot, which is perhaps a novelty in Turkish
travel. Our only impedimenta consisted of the knapsack
and sleeping gear on our backs, so that we were entirely
independent; and being able to use our legs and arms and
sleep out in the forest, we were able to surmount mountains
and penetrate into districts which, I think I may
say, have never been described, and it is possible never
visited, by an ‘European’ before.</p>

<p>If this book should do anything to interest Englishmen
in a land and people among the most interesting
in Europe, and to open people’s eyes to the evils of
the government under which the Bosniacs suffer, its object
will have been fully attained. Those who may be
inclined to ‘try Bosnia’ will meet with many hardships.
They must be prepared to sleep out in the open air, in
the forest, or on the mountain-side. They will have now
and then to put up with indifferent food, or supply their
own commissariat. They will nowhere meet with mountains
so fine as the Alps of Switzerland or Tyrol, and
they will be disappointed if they search for æsthetic embellishments
in the towns. But those who are curious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span>
as to some of the most absorbing political problems of
modern Europe; those who delight in out-of-the-way
revelations of antiquity, and who perceive the high historic
and ethnologic interest which attaches to the Southern
Sclaves; and lastly, those who take pleasure in picturesque
costumes and stupendous forest scenery; will be amply
rewarded by a visit to Bosnia. There is much beautiful
mountain scenery as well, and the member of the Alpine
Club who has a taste for the jagged outlines of the Dolomites
and the Julian Alps, in spite of a certain amount of
attendant limestone nakedness, may find some peaks
worthy of his attention towards the Montenegrine frontier.
It would not be difficult to mention routes of greater
natural attractions than that we followed, and I may observe
that the falls of the Pliva, which we did not see,
have been reckoned among the most beautiful waterfalls
in Europe.</p>

<p>The first two chapters, written mostly while delayed
in Croatia, refer rather to the borderland of Bosnia, and
may not be of general interest, dealing much in costumes
and antiquities. The last, which describes the old Republic
of Ragusa, may serve to show that the Southern
Sclaves are capable of the highest culture and civilisation.
In the Historical Review of Bosnia I have attempted to
elucidate and emphasise a most important aspect of Bosnian
history—the connection, namely, between that till
lately almost unknown land, and the Protestant Reformation
of Europe, and the debt which even civilised England
owes to that now unhappy country.</p>

</div>

<p>About the middle of the fifth century, when Britain was passing
definitely into the hands of the English, and when on the Continent
the hordes of Attila were dealing the most tremendous
blow that had yet fallen on the Roman Empire, Sclavonic
tribes overran Mœsia, Thrace, Macedonia, and Illyricum, and
pushed on to the Adriatic shores. From this period the final
settlement of the Sclaves in the area of what is now known as
Turkey-in-Europe may be safely dated.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Their first ravages
over, the Sclaves, who from their communal family-organisation
were little capable of formidable combination, appear to have
easily accepted Roman suzerainty. The new settlers were soon
among the most trusted troops of the Eastern Emperor, and at
the beginning of the sixth century the Sclavonic colony of Dardania
gives Eastern Rome one of its most renowned Emperors
and its greatest general. The Sclave Upravda, the son of
Istok, is better known as the Emperor Justinian, and Veličaŕ
as Belisarius.</p>

<p>Thus were first cemented those peculiar relations between
the Sclaves and Byzantium which are still of supreme importance
in considering ‘the Eastern Question.’ The Byzantine
government saw itself so capable of dealing with the Sclaves,
that when the Avar nomads, at the beginning of the seventh
century, devastated Illyricum, massacring alike Sclavonic settler
and Roman provincial, and sacking even the coast cities of
Dalmatia, Heraclius, as a masterstroke of policy, called in two
new Sclavonic tribes from beyond the Danube as a counterpoise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxiv"></a>[xxiv]</span>
to the Avars; and the corner of the Balkan peninsula between
the Save, the Morava, and the Adriatic, was divided among the
Sclavonic tribes, the Serbs, and the Croats, who still throughout
this area form the bulk of the population.</p>

<p>The account given of this settlement by Constantine Porphyrogenitus<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
is so mixed up with mythical elements that we
can only accept the general outlines. As might be expected
from the analogy of our own history of the conquest of Britain,
the Sclavonic sagas, which seem to form the basis of the Byzantine
version, bring into the field certain leaders with eponymic
names;<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> but the old family life of the Sclaves asserts itself even
in these legends, and we read that the Croats were led to the
conquest of the Avars by a family of brothers and sisters.</p>

<p>The Croatian settlement seems to have been the earlier.
The Croats came from the countries beyond the Carpathians,
and colonized the countries now known as Austrian and
Turkish Croatia, and the northern part of Dalmatia. The
Save formed a rough boundary to the Croatian nationality on
the north, the Verbas on the east, and to the south the Cetina.</p>

<p>The Serbs, then inhabiting a part of what is now Galicia,
hastened to imitate the example of the Croats, and took for
their share the lands to the east and south of that occupied
by their brother race. They occupied the whole, or nearly
the whole, of the area now occupied by Free Serbia, Bosnia,
Herzegovina, Montenegro, Old Serbia, and the northern half
of Albania, and stretched themselves along the Adriatic coasts
from the neighbourhood of Spalato, where the river Cetina
runs into the sea, to Durazzo, then still Dyrrhachium. Thus,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxv"></a>[xxv]</span>
with the exception of the barren corner called the Kraina, or
Turkish Croatia, the whole of what is now known as Bosnia,
with which we have particularly to deal, belongs to the Serbian
branch of the Sclaves.</p>

<p>For long the history of what later became the Bosnian kingdom
is indistinguishable from that of the rest of the Serbs.
The whole Illyrian triangle was divided into a great number of
small independent districts, somewhat answering to the Teutonic
‘<i>Gaus</i>,’ called Župy. Župa means ‘bond’<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> or confederation,
and each Župa was simply a confederation of village communities,
whose union was represented by a magistrate or
governor, called a Župan. The Župans in turn seem to have
chosen a Grand-Župan, who may be looked on as the President
of the Serbian Federation. We know little about the early
Županships of the Bosnian area, but a few of the petty commonwealths
of the Serbian coastland, and what later on became
the Herzegovina, are mentioned by the Byzantine Emperor
Constantine Porphyrogenitus, who wrote about 950, and the
names and situation of some in the Bosnian interior may be
gathered from ecclesiastical diplomas. Here and there we read
of a ‘Ban’ (translated, in Diocleas, by the Latin word ‘<i>Dux</i>’),
who was rather higher than an ordinary Župan.</p>

<p>These Serbian ‘Archons,’ as the Byzantine historians speak
of them, acknowledged the suzerainty of the Eastern Empire,
and even, in some cases (though doubtless to a less extent than
the Croats), accepted Byzantine dignities. Thus a Ban of
Zachlumia accepted the titles of Proconsul and Patrician. Later
on, when Czar Simeon erected the new Bulgarian Empire,
Serbia was forced for a while to bow to the dominion of the
conqueror of Leo Phocas. In the tenth century the Serbs
shake off the Bulgarian yoke, and we now begin to hear of
four Grand-Župans, whose jurisdictions answer to Serbia proper,
Rascia, Dioclea, and Bosnia. The power of the lesser Župans
was during this period being diminished for the benefit of these
greater potentates, who in Bosnia are generally known as Bans.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxvi"></a>[xxvi]</span>
‘The Bans,’ says the contemporary Serbian historian,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> ‘ruled
each of them in his own province, and subjugated the Župans,
receiving from them the taxes which beforetime had been paid
to the King,’ <i>i.e.</i> the sole Grand-Župan.</p>

<p>During the ninth and tenth centuries, while Bosnian-Serbian
history is still so obscure, that of the Croats had achieved
some prominence. The settlement of the Croats had, as we
have seen, somewhat preceded the Serbian. They bordered on
the coast-cities of Dalmatia, where Roman nationality and something
of Roman civilization still lingered. Their relations with
Byzantium were more defined, and they had also for a moment
entered into the system of the renovated Empire of the West.
Thus the Croats were earlier imbued with Christianity than the
Serbs, and external influences were earlier at work to give their
too acephalous government greater unity than their inland
neighbours, still under the full sway of Sclavonic communism,
could attain to. In the year 914 a Croatian Grand-Župan,
Tomislav, who, in virtue of his relations to the Byzantine
government and the Roman population of the Dalmatian cities,
had assumed the title of ‘Consul,’ begins to be known to foreign
princes as ‘King of the Croats.’ The successor of Tomislav is
said to have conquered the neighbouring Serbian Banat, which
from the principal river within its confines begins about this
time to be known as Bosona, or Bosnia. It even became a constitutional
principle in Croatia that, when the king died childless,
a new king should be elected by the seven Bans of the
crown-lands, one of whom was the Ban of Bosnia.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>But this Croatian suzerainty was, as yet, premature. At the
beginning of the eleventh century the Greek Emperor Basil
having completed the slaughter of the Bulgarians succeeded in
subjugating the Croats, and the introduction of Byzantine
Governors and Protospathars into Dalmatia threw back Bosnia<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxvii"></a>[xxvii]</span>
on to the support of her Serbian neighbours.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The Bosnian
Ban Niklas not only accepted the Serbian Grand-Župan Dobroslav
as his overlord, but aided him most efficaciously in annihilating
two Byzantine armies<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> in those gorges of the Black
Mountain which, from time immemorial, have been so fatal to
the ambition of Stamboul.</p>

<p>Thus down to nearly the middle of the twelfth century,
Bosnia continued to own allegiance to her Serbian suzerains,
and the claims of the Croats to Bosnia continued to be little
more than nominal till their own country fell into hands more
capable of enforcing them. But at the beginning of the twelfth
century the Magyars overthrew the kingdom of the Croats,
and in 1141 Geiza II. of Hungary completed the conquest of
Bosnia, or, as it is generally known in the Hungarian annals, of
Rama, from the little river of that name, flowing into the
Narenta.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> Still, the Hungarian dominion does not seem as
yet to have been much more than a vague suzerainty. Bosnia,
indeed, throughout the whole of this period, seems to have
stood aloof from all its neighbours. It might own a nominal
allegiance, now to Serbia, now to Croatia, now to Hungary,
but it enjoyed a practical independence. Its general isolation
from the main current of Serbian history may be gathered from
the chronicler of Dioclea; and when Manuel Comnenus reduced
Hungary to a temporary subjection, his historian Cinnamus was
struck with the same phenomenon. ‘The Drina,’ says he, ‘divides<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxviii"></a>[xxviii]</span>
Bosthna from the rest of Serbia. For Bosthna is not subject
to the Grand-Župan of Serbia, but the people were at that
time under their own magistrates, and used their own customs.’
The recent Russian historian of the Serbs and Bulgarians<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
traces many of the later misfortunes of Bosnia to this
fatal estrangement from the other Sclavonic lands.</p>

<p>The Hungarian alliance now makes this alienation irrevocable.
Cinnamus shows the close relations existing between Bosnia
and Hungary at the date of Manuel’s invasion when he goes
on to say that ‘Boritzes,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Exarch of Bosthna,’ aided the King
of Hungary against the Greeks; and, indeed, we know from
other sources that the Bosnian Ban was himself an illegitimate
son of the Magyar king, Coloman. Manuel reduced Bosnia,
with Croatia and other parts of Hungary, for a while; but the
Ban was not long in recovering the province. The Hungarian
connection was only cemented the more firmly, and on Borić’s
death, in 1168, his son, the new Ban Culin, accepted his investiture
from Bela III., and subscribed himself henceforth
<i>Fiduciarius Regni Hungariæ</i>.</p>

<p>The rule of Ban Culin is justly regarded as the brightest
period in the annals of Christian Bosnia. His first care on
his accession was to surround himself with trustworthy Župans
and Voivodes, and during the thirty-six years of his reign
Bosnia enjoyed a profound peace. Under his auspices and
protection the merchants of Ragusa began to plant their
factories in Bosnia, and open out anew the rich mines which
had been left unworked since the days of the Romans.
The very year after Culin’s accession, two Ragusan brothers
built a factory and opened mines on the site of what has since
become the capital of Bosnia.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Other mines were shortly
opened in the neighbourhood, and a fortress, called after the
Sclavonic name of their mother city, Dubrovnik, was built by
the same enterprising merchants to protect their industries.
The same wise policy encouraged another immigration, this time,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxix"></a>[xxix]</span>
of Saxon miners, who, like the Ragusans, did much to lay
bare the great mineral wealth of this and the other Serbian lands,
and who have left their traces in several old German mining
expressions still current among the miners and mountaineers
of Bosnia. These Saxons, or <i>Sasi</i>, settled chiefly in the
towns, where their influence was valuable in instilling something
of the civic unity of the free Teutonic burghs into the
loosely compacted aggregation of hovels that clustered round
the fortified ‘grad’ of the Bosnian lord.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Culin is said to have
been the first Bosnian prince who struck coins, and the general
prosperity was such that to this day ‘the times of good Ban
Culin’ are invoked by the Bosniac when he wishes to express
the golden age.</p>

<p>But the patronage which Culin afforded to a religious sect
that now becomes prominent in Bosnia makes his rule of still
greater importance, and leads us to the consideration of a subject
which has its bearings even on English history.</p>

<p>The doctrine of the Two Principles of Good and Evil, which
had its origin perhaps in the sublime mythology of Persia
and the eternal conflict of Light and Darkness, held its own
amongst the various Gnostic sects of Christianity, scattered
throughout the Eastern world, while the West was content to
slumber in comparative orthodoxy. In Armenia, where these
doctrines had certain affinities with the earlier religion, they
seem to have taken especially firm root; and here, as in the
other border states of the Byzantine Empire, heterodoxy went
hand in hand with patriotism. Considering the hostile relations
in which both nations stood to Byzantium, it is not at all
surprising that friendly communications should have subsisted
between the Armenians and the Bulgarian Sclaves whose
country lay to the east of the Serbians. Further, it was extremely
natural that Armenians, for national as well as sectarian
reasons, should view with jealousy the progress of orthodox<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxx"></a>[xxx]</span>
missionaries among the Bulgarians, and should attempt to
counteract it by organising a propaganda of their own Manichæism.</p>

<p>Such was actually set on foot. How early this proselytism
was first commenced is doubtful, but it is certain that the
Danubian Sclaves were converted from heathenism <i>pari passu</i>
by Manichæan and orthodox missionaries. The Byzantine
Emperors, by their transplantation system, gave the Armenians
every facility for their work. In the middle of the eighth
century Constantine Copronymus, who had perhaps some sympathies
with the heretics, transplanted a body of Paulicians
from Armenia into Thrace, who we learn, on the authority of
Cedrenus, spread the Paulician heresy through those parts, then
largely inhabited by the Bulgarian Sclaves. At the end of the
ninth century, when the persecution of Byzantium had provoked
the Paulicians of Armenia to assert their independence,
when ‘the Roman Emperor fled before the heretics whom
his mother had condemned to the flames,’ and Tephricé became
the capital of a free-state devoted to Gnostic Christianity, the
missionary efforts of the Armenians among the Sclaves was
prosecuted with still greater vigour. Petrus Siculus, who in
870 resided nine months at Tephricé as legate of the Byzantine
Government, to arrange for an exchange of prisoners, discovered
that a Manichæan mission was about to start from Tephricé
to the Bulgarians, and addressed his ‘Historia Manichæorum’
to the Bulgarian Patriarch, with the express purpose of counteracting
these baneful efforts.</p>

<p>The fall of the Paulician free-state of Tephricé synchronizes
with the rise of the first Bulgarian Empire, and we can well
imagine that the refugees of vanquished Armenia found shelter
among their Manichæan co-religionists in the dominions of
Czar Simeon, the hero of the Achelous. From this period
onwards the Paulician heresy may be said to change its nationality,
and to become Sclavonic. According to the Bulgarian
national traditions,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> a certain priest named Bogomil spread the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxi"></a>[xxxi]</span>
Manichæan doctrines among the subjects of the Bulgarian Czar
who succeeded Simeon, Peter Simeonović. A more enlightened
criticism will perhaps see in the name ‘Bogomil’ only another
instance of that ‘eponymic’ tendency of barbarous minds
which refers to individuals events and institutions which have
really a more national character. In the same Bulgarian document
which professes to give the origin of their name, they are
connected with the Massalian heresy; by Harmenopulos and
other Byzantine writers they are made almost or quite identical
with these same Massalians, and with the Euchites, their Greek
equivalent, and there seems to be no reasonable doubt that the
name Bogomile is really nothing but a Sclavonic translation of
the Greek and Syriac names for the sect. The name of Massalians
is derived from a Syriac word, signifying ‘those who
pray,’ and the Greek Euchites have of course the same derivation.
The Byzantine writer Epiphanius<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> has the credit of
giving the right etymology of the word Bogomile, in that he
derives it from the Bulgarian words <i>Bog z’milui</i>, signifying
‘God have mercy,’ an etymology which fits in with that peculiar
devotion to prayer which was characteristic of the Bogomilian
religion, which harmonizes with that of the allied sectaries,
the Massalians and Euchites, and which would be still intelligible
to all Sclavonic peoples, from the White Sea to the Ægean.</p>

<p>We need not, however, go so far as to deny that the Bogomilian
heresy took its characteristic shape under the direction
of a Bulgarian heresiarch. The historic existence of the first
Bogomilian pope seems sufficiently attested,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> but the Bulgarian
traditions name him indifferently Jeremias and Bogomil, and
it is quite possible that the latter name was added at a later
time by a confusion with the Sclavonic homonym for Massalians
and Euchites.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxii"></a>[xxxii]</span></p>

<p>Through all the varying phases of Bulgarian history the
Bogomiles, as these Sclavonic Manichæans are now known, hold
their own. It seems certain that the Bulgarian Czars, in their
struggle with Byzantium, did not wish to alienate a powerful
party at home, and we hear occasionally ominous whispers
that Bulgarian Emperors themselves leaned towards the doctrine
of the Two Principles.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> The Bulgarian heresy was perpetually
fed from its Oriental sources by new Byzantine transplantations,
and in the tenth century the Emperor John Zimisces
did much for the propagation of Gnosticism among the Sclaves
by transporting a more powerful colony of Armenians than any
that had gone before ‘from the Chalybian hills to the valleys of
Mount Hæmus.’ It is now that the Bogomilian heresy begins
to spread beyond the limits of Bulgaria, among the kindred
Serbian tribes to the west. Bulgaria, earlier civilized from
her closer contact with Byzantium, was exercising during these
centuries a predominating influence over the less cultured
Serbs. From the Bulgarian missionaries Serbia first received
the seeds of her orthodox Christianity, and there can be no
doubt that proselytism was at work on the Manichæan side as
well. Add to this that a large part of Serbia fell at different
times under the Bulgarian dominion.</p>

<p>By the end of the tenth century the Bogomiles have taken
firm root among the Serbs. In the legend of the Serbian
prince, St. Vladimir,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> one of his highest merits is that he was
the zealous enemy of the Bogomiles. St. Vladimir certainly included
in his dominions parts of what is now the Herzegovina,
and, according to some accounts, Bosnia as well.</p>

<p>The events which now follow must have largely increased
the number of Manichæans in these and the other Serbian
lands. Basil, ‘the slayer of the Bulgarians,’ at the beginning
of the eleventh century, finally overthrew the first Bulgarian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxiii"></a>[xxxiii]</span>
Empire. Towards the end of the same century the Bulgarian
heretics, now under Byzantine rule, were hunted down by
the orthodox Emperor. The Princess Anna Comnena<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> has left
us an account of the persecution of the Bogomiles by her father
Alexius. The Byzantine princess unblushingly relates the trap
which the Emperor condescended to set for the chief apostle
of the sect, at that time a certain Basil; how he artfully led
on the heresiarch by holding out hopes of conversion; how
he invited him to the imperial table, and in his closet wormed
out of him the secrets of his sect; and then, suddenly throwing
aside the arras on the wall, revealed the scribe who had taken
down the confession of his heresy, and beckoned to his apparitors
to throw his victim into irons. The account which Anna
Comnena gives of this sect is valuable in spite of its scurrility.
The princess calls the Bogomiles ‘a mixture of Manichees and
Massalians.’ She laughs at their uncombed hair, their low
origin,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> and their long faces, ‘which they hide to the nose, and
walk bowed, attired like monks, muttering something between
their lips.’ Basil himself was ‘a lanky man, with a sparse beard,
tall and thin.’ From the account given of his confession we
have intimations of a belief in the phantastic doctrine, and
what was more shocking still, ‘He called the sacred churches—woe
is me!—the sacred churches, fanes of demons!’ When he
saw himself betrayed by the Emperor, he declared that he would
be rescued from death by ‘angels and demons.’ Anna Comnena
would like to say more of this cursed heresy, ‘but modesty keeps
me from doing so, as beautiful Sappho says somewhere; for
though I am an historian, I am also a woman, and the most
honourable of the purple, and the first offshoot of Alexius.’
The ‘most honourable of the purple,’ however, feels no hesitation
in describing the holocaust which her father made of all
the Bogomiles he could catch, and more particularly the
roasting of Basil. This delicately sensitive princess gloats over
the preparations in the hippodrome, the crackling of the fire,
the breaking out of poor human nature as the victim comes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxiv"></a>[xxxiv]</span>
nearer to the scorching, the turning away of his eyes, and
finally the quivering of his limbs. One asks, in amazement,
whether any religion that has ever existed in the world has produced
such monsters of humanity as Christianity calling itself
orthodox!</p>

<p>It may readily be believed that these persecutions drove
the Bogomiles to take refuge more and more in the Serbian
regions, out of the way of the orthodox savagery of Byzantium.
There were moreover reasons which diverted the current of
heresy from that part of Serbia which became afterwards the
nucleus of the Empire of the Némanjas. The Serbian princes
who ruled over the territory now occupied by old Serbia and
Montenegro were faithful sons of the orthodox church, and
directed their utmost efforts to keep the shrine of St. Vladimir
and the national patriarchate of Dioclea free from the contamination
of Manichæism. Thus a variety of causes combined
to direct the course of the new movement to the Serbian races
of Western Illyricum; and in the twelfth century—the century
immediately preceding the outbreak of Gnostic Puritanism in
Western Europe—Bosnia had become the head-quarters of what
we may now call the great Sclavonic Heresy.</p>

<p>Thanks to the publication of many South-Sclavonic archives,
we are now in a position to arrive at the tenets of the
Bogomiles, from native as well as from Byzantine sources; and,
as I hope to show, both the Greek and Sclavonic accounts of the
sect which now plays such an important part in Bosnian history
harmonize to a very great extent. The best native account that
we possess of the Bogomilian heretics is to be found in the works
of a Bulgarian writer, one Presbyter Cosmas, who lived at the
end of the tenth century, just at the period when the heresy
was striking root among the Serbs and Bosniacs, and who wrote
(in his native tongue) two of his most important works against
the Bogomiles—whom he considers ‘worse and more horrible
than demons!’<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxv"></a>[xxxv]</span></p>

<p>One of the fundamental doctrines of the Bogomiles was, as
has been already implied, the belief in two Principles of Good
and Evil. ‘I hear,’ says the worthy Presbyter Cosmas, ‘many
of our orthodox congregation ask, “Wherefore does God permit
the Devil to exercise sway over man?” Verily this is the
first question which prepares the weak in belief for the reception
of the Manichæan heresy.’ The Bogomiles satisfied their
reason by supposing two conflicting self-existent principles of
Good and Evil. Matter and the visible world belong to the
Spirit of Evil. ‘Everything,’ says Cosmas, ‘exists, according to
the Bogomiles, of the will of the Devil. The sky, the sun, the
earth, men, churches, crosses, and all that is God’s, they give
over to the Devil.’ The evil in the world is thus accounted for
by supposing the Creation to be the work of the Evil One, and it
consequently followed that the Bogomiles looked on the book
of Genesis and the other Mosaic writings as inspired by this
evil God, or, as they knew him, Satanael. But beyond this
visible world, of which they could see only the dark and melancholy
side, there existed, according to the Bogomiles, another,
invisible, heavenly and perfect, the creation of the Spirit of
Goodness and Light—Himself a perfect triune Being, from
whom proceeded nothing incomplete or temporary.</p>

<p>Cosmas distinguishes, however, two branches of the Bogomilian
heretics.</p>

<p>According to the earlier sect, dualism in its most uncompromising
form prevailed.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> According to a later offshoot of
the Bogomiles, the Spirit of Good had two sons, the elder
of whom, Satanael, rebelled and created matter, and that to
rescue the world thus created from the dominion of the Prince
of Evil, God the Father sent down his younger son Christ to
enable men to combat the Ruler of this world.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> Both sects,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxvi"></a>[xxxvi]</span>
however, were agreed in accepting the Phantastic theory of the
Incarnation. The antagonism between spirit and matter was
too great to admit of the union of the two. The body of Christ
was a phantom, left in the clouds at his ascension; and the
Virgin was an angel and not the mother of God.</p>

<p>Cosmas denies generally their belief in any of the books of
the Old Testament or the Gospels; but this does not agree with
the circumstantial account of Euthymius Zygabenus, who from
having been commissioned by the Emperor to extract the tenets
of his sect from the Bogomilian heresiarch Basil, is certainly
one of the best authorities. Further, it is disproved by the
whole conduct of the Bogomiles, which, as Cosmas himself
shows, was based on a too literal interpretation of the Gospels.
According to Euthymius,<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> the Bogomiles accepted seven holy
books, which he enumerates as follows:—1, the Psalms; 2, the
Sixteen Prophets; 3, 4, 5, and 6, the Gospels; 7, the Acts of
the Apostles, the Epistles, and the Apocalypse. So far, indeed,
as the New Testament was concerned, they clung to the version
of the orthodox Sclavic apostle, in which they altered not a
word.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p>Touching baptism again, accounts are contradictory. Harmenopulos
says that the Bogomiles practised the rite, but did
not attribute to it any perfecting<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> virtue. On the other hand,
the most recent investigations into the observances of the Bogomiles
of Bosnia show that strictly speaking the rite did not exist
among them at all, though they observed something analogous
to it. Only adults could be admitted into the communion
of the faithful; and, after they had first qualified themselves for
admission by prayer and fasting, the mystery of initiation was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxvii"></a>[xxxvii]</span>
performed, not by water—for did not water itself appertain to
the evil realm of matter?—but by the laying on of St. John’s
Gospel. Thus Cosmas is technically right in saying that the
Bogomiles rejected baptism altogether, though it is probable
that he was merely calumniating them when he added as a
reason, that ‘they are afraid of the children to be baptized;
and if by chance they see small children, they turn away from
them as from carrion, and spit, and call them children of mammon,
as being creations of the Devil;’ still under the sway,
that is, of the Evil Creator Spirit. As regards Bosnia, at any
rate, this is a foul slander. So far were the Bosnian Bogomiles
from spurning little children, that the instruction of the
young was considered a work worthy of the most saintly of
the sect.</p>

<p>They were staunch opponents of the prevailing Mariolatry.
‘They pay no honour to the Mother of God.’<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> ‘As to the
cross,’ says the Presbyter, they say: ‘Wherefore should we bow
to that which dishonoured God?’ and they ask further, ‘if any
man slew the son of a king with a bit of wood, how could this
bit of wood be dear to the king?’<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> They considered it idolatry
to bow down before the icons of saints. ‘They further revile the
ceremonies of the church and all church dignities, and they call
orthodox priests blind Pharisees, and bay at them as dogs at
horses.’<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> ‘As to the Lord’s Supper,’ continues the Bulgarian
champion of orthodoxy, ‘they assert that it is not kept according
to God’s commandment, and that it is not the body of
God, but ordinary bread.’<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>Their belief in the evilness of matter was productive, as such
a belief always has been, of much asceticism; which, if the concurrent
testimony of their enemies is to be believed, they carried
at times to deplorable excesses. ‘They show themselves,’ says
Cosmas, ‘strong ascetics, for they call the Devil the Creator of
all things, and declare that it is his Commandment that men<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxviii"></a>[xxxviii]</span>
should take wives, eat flesh, and drink wine. Everything as it
exists with us (the orthodox) is utterly rejected. They give
themselves up to a celestial life, insomuch that they call married
men and those living in the way of the world “Mammon’s Children.”’
The descriptions of Anna Comnena and the monk Cosmas
bring before us the familiar Puritan type, as it has reproduced
itself in all ages. They bowed their heads and groaned and
pulled long faces, in the true Roundhead style. ‘You will see
heretics,’ quoth Cosmas, ‘quiet and peaceful as lambs without,
silent, and wan with hypocritical fasting, who do not speak much
nor laugh loud, who let their beard grow, and leave their person
incompt.’</p>

<p>These descriptions of their enemies must, however, be taken
with this reserve: they apply, as a rule, only to a small minority
of the sect. The Bogomiles, like most ascetic sects, were divided
into two castes: the simple believers, the <i>Credentes</i> of the
West, who formed the large majority; and ‘the perfect,’ or those
who by a long course of asceticism had successfully mortified
the flesh. In the thirteenth century, at the most blooming period
of their history, among the millions of these sectaries were
reckoned less than 4,000 of ‘the perfect.’<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> These ‘perfect’
called themselves in Bosnia <i>Krstjani</i>, <i>dobri Bošniani</i>, <i>Svršiteli</i>,
‘Christians,’ that is, ‘good Bosnians,’ or ‘the elect,’ terms which
reappear in a Romance guise in Italy and the Languedoc. The
‘perfect’ were clad like monks in long black gowns; they condemned
themselves to perpetual celibacy; they abjured wine,
nor tasted aught but vegetables, fish, and oil; they forsook
the ‘pomps and vanities of this wicked world,’ and gave themselves
up to devotion and good works. The women (for this
saintly minority included both sexes) taught children or
tended the sick, while the men acted as the spiritual guides of
their weaker brethren or preached the Gospel among unbelievers.</p>

<p>But it stood to reason that the great bulk of the Bogomilian
flock could never attain to this higher standard. In the
abstract, no doubt, the simple ‘believer’ accepted the doctrine
which his spiritual guides were careful to instil into him, that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xxxix"></a>[xxxix]</span>
his soul was an angel fallen from above and fettered in the
prison-house of his body, and that only by perpetual mortification
of the flesh could he hope to set the celestial captive free
at last. But the laws of nature and society are perpetually
holding back religious extravagance from its logical consequences,
and the simple ‘believer’ was content to govern himself
by the more ordinary standard of mankind. As in Provence
and Italy, so in Bosnia, he dispensed himself from the prohibition
against drinking wine; and though the ‘perfect’ refused to
bear arms and preached against war as devilish, the mass of the
heretics, Sclavonic as well as Romance, showed that on occasion
they could measure swords with the most orthodox. Though
marriage was contrary to their tenets, the Bogomiles took wives,
the man, however, in Bosnia only taking the woman on the
condition that she was good and true to him, reserving the
right of dismissing her if he thought her conduct unsatisfactory;
an arrangement productive of laxity, and giving
occasion to the orthodox adversary of which he was not
slow to take advantage.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Yet, though in his manner of life
falling short of the extreme asceticism of ‘the perfect,’ the
ordinary Bogomile, on the showing of his enemies themselves,
distinguished himself by his superior industry and thrift, and
put to shame the saintly idleness of more orthodox professors by
refusing to neglect his work on feast-days. Among the Bogomiles,
beggars were looked on with contempt.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The ‘perfect’
themselves abhorred what was slothful in a monastic life, and
the ‘heresiarch’ Basil set a good example by earning his
living as a doctor. The simple believer devoted part of the
worldly goods thus acquired to the relief of sick and indigent
brothers, and also to the support of Gospellers among unbelievers,
but neither his industry nor his good works could
satisfy his conscience. The higher life of the ‘perfect’ was a
perpetual reproach to him. His soul seemed clotted with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xl"></a>[xl]</span>
contagion of a too sensual existence, nor did his theology allow
him a purgatory for the imbodied and imbruted spirit. Standing
on the threshold of another world, and forced to choose
between heaven and hell, the simple ‘believer’ considered it
essential to his salvation that he should be admitted into the
ranks of the ‘perfect’ by a death-bed ceremony of initiation,
which reappears as <i>la Convenenza</i> among the more Western
Patarenes of Italy and Provence.</p>

<p>The Bogomiles, in spite of their hatred of orthodox priests
and temples, possessed ministers and even conventicles of their
own. In the earliest accounts that have reached us we find at
the head of the sect an elder or teacher surrounded by twelve
disciples, answering to Christ and the Apostles. The half
legendary accounts of the ‘pope’ Bogomil surround him with
such disciples; and Basil ‘the heresiarch’ has his twelve. But
as the Bogomiles spread beyond the limits of Bulgaria, each
new province, if we may so term it, added to the dominion of the
faithful, required a new elder or bishop. At the head of the
Bogomilian flock in Bosnia stood a <i>Djed</i> or elder, answering to
the <i>Episcopus</i> or <i>Senior</i> of the Albigensians, and under him
came the Apostles, the <i>Strojniks</i> (Western <i>Magistri</i>), of which
there were two grades, the <i>Gosti</i> and the <i>Starci</i>, who again reappear
as the <i>Filii</i> and <i>Diaconi</i> of Italy. But there was no
hierarchy, and nothing at all answering to a papacy; ‘the ecclesiastical
officers were simply the representatives of the congregation,
and were chosen by their votes.’<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Every one who
ranked among the ‘perfect,’ whether a man or woman, had the
right of preaching.</p>

<p>Although in some parts the Bogomiles seem to have had no
recognized place of worship, and performed their devotions in
their own huts, or on some lonely heath beneath the open
canopy of heaven, we have yet sufficient evidence, both
Byzantine and Sclavonic, that they often possessed meeting-houses
of their own. Their churches, according to Epiphanius,
were like boats turned keel uppermost, but some were of a more
ecclesiastical form. It appears that in Bosnia, as in the Languedoc,
their prayer-houses were plain sheds without tower, or
bells, which they called the trumpets of demons,—devoid of ornament<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xli"></a>[xli]</span>
or icons, containing neither chancel nor altar, but a simple
table covered with a clean white linen cloth, on which was laid a
copy of the Gospels.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> Here they assembled by torchlight and
sang hymns of their own, called by the Greek writer ‘Euphemies.’
Their service chiefly consisted of prayer, which according
to their creed was the only means of resisting the demon within
them, or of attaining salvation. The Lord’s Prayer was the only
form used by them, and this they repeated in their own house
with closed doors, five times every day and five times every night.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Such are some of the main features of the Bogomilian heresy,
as they have come down to us, to a great extent, from the writings
of their bitterest opponents. Nor will anyone marvel that these
doctrines should have spread as they did among those Sclavonic
races, who acted as the missionaries of the first Reformation in
Western Europe. It can hardly be considered fanciful if we detect
certain remarkable analogies between the belief and observances
of the Bogomiles and the primitive institutions, and even the
heathen religion, of the Sclaves. It has already been mentioned
that the Manichæan conversion began among the Bulgarians when
they were still to a great extent pagan. The same is true with
regard to the spread of the Bogomilian heresy among the Serbs,
with whom heathendom held its own in parts till the thirteenth
century.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> A remarkable uniformity presents itself in the languages,
beliefs, and institutions of all Sclavonic nations; and if
we may assert, from the analogy of the Baltic Sclaves, that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlii"></a>[xlii]</span>
Bulgarians and Serbs also divided their worship between their
Black God or Spirit of Evil, and their White God or Spirit of
Good, it follows that the Manichæan missionaries found the
dualistic theology, which lies at the bottom of so much of their
doctrine, already existing among the people they wished to
convert;<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> while the propagandists of orthodoxy must have discovered
to their vexation that the Sclavonic mind had been
trained by superstition, as well as by what mother-wit it possessed,
to rebel against their stupendous dogma, that an All-powerful
Spirit of Good could create and tolerate the Spirit of
Evil. Our Presbyter Cosmas notices that this difficulty presented
itself, even to the ‘orthodox’ Bulgarians, and so lost
is he in indignation at these profane inquiries as to the devil’s
paternity, that he forgets to answer them.</p>

<p>An equally marked parallel is presented between the customs
and church government, if the expression is allowable, of the
Bogomiles, and the primitive institutions of the Sclaves. Their
Presbyters answer to the Sclavonic <i>Starescina</i>, the elders of
the primitive family-community. The Communistic doctrines
which these heretics discovered in the New Testament fitted
in well with the equality and fraternity of the Sclavonic
home-life. They were essentially levellers, and their evangelic
religion was mixed up, as among the Puritans of Western
Europe, with political insurgency. In Bulgaria we seem to
trace, in the opposition of the Bogomiles to the powers that
be, an alliance between them and the champions of the Sclavonic
democracy against the usurpations of the Ugrian dynasty
and nobles. ‘They rail,’ says Cosmas, ‘at the magistrates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xliii"></a>[xliii]</span>
and boljars (or nobles), and hold it a crime to do service
for the Czar. They say, moreover, to every servant that he
should not serve his master.’ The Bogomiles, it must be remembered,
become a political power in Bosnia just at the time
when the ‘elders’ and Župans, who represented the free institutions
which the Sclavonic settlers brought with them, are
bowing before the Bans and a new, semi-feudal, nobility.</p>

<p>By the beginning of the twelfth century the Bogomilian
heresy had struck such firm root in Bosnia as to rouse the faithful
sons of the Church in Hungary and Dalmatia to armed opposition,
insomuch that in 1138 Bela II. was induced to make
an incursion against the ‘Patarenes,’ in the country between the
Cetina and Narenta.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> It was not, however, till the end of this
century that the progress of heresy in other parts turned
the Pope’s serious attention to the fountain-head of the
‘Bulgarian heresy,’ then undoubtedly his Illyrian province.
Nominally, Bosnia had long belonged to the Church of Rome,
which claimed Western Illyricum as an inheritance from the
Western Empire. Practically, what orthodox Christianity Bosnia
and the other Serbian lands possessed was of a strongly national
character, and derived, not from Roman sources, but from the
missionary efforts of the Sclavonic apostles, Cyril and Methodius.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>
But the Church of Bosnia, though using the native
liturgy and eschewing the Latin language, acknowledged some
allegiance to Rome, and the bishops of Bosnia recognized the
Archbishop of Salona<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> as their metropolitan. In the year
1180 Culin himself is still considered a dutiful son of the
Church. But a few years later Culin ‘has degenerated from
himself’ and fallen into heresy, and together with his wife<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and
his sister, the widow of the Count of Chelm, had given ear to the
Patarenes, as Roman ecclesiastics begin to call the Bogomiles
who have now spread their heresy into Italy and the West.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xliv"></a>[xliv]</span>
The Pope, exerting pressure on Culin by means of the King of
Hungary, had the satisfaction of seeing him recant in person at
Rome.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> But a few years later, in 1199, the Prince of orthodox
Zenta, which we may almost translate Montenegro, informs the
Pope by letter that Culin has relapsed into his errors, and that
ten thousand of his subjects are already infected with the
heresy.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> A little later, we hear that Daniel, the bishop of
Bosnia himself, has joined the Patarenes, who shortly after
destroyed the orthodox-Roman Cathedral and Episcopal palace
at Crescevo. From this time begins an ominous interregnum in
the Roman Episcopate of Bosnia.</p>

<p>It was in vain that the Pope appealed to the King of Hungary
to punish his heretic vassal. Culin was now too strong to fear even
the Hungarian arms; and at the very period when the hordes of De
Montfort were devastating Provence, the Banat of Bosnia offered
an asylum to persecuted adherents of the Bulgarian heresy
throughout Europe. This is hardly the place to show how essentially
the first Protestants of Western Europe, the Bulgares as they
are called by orthodox writers of the age, were spiritual children
of the Sclavonic Bogomiles. The history of the Patarenes and
Albigenses of Italy and Provence, of the ‘Ketzers’<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> of the Lower
Rhine, who made their way even to our shores, lies of course
beyond the scope of this essay. Word for word, nearly all that
has been, with some pains, collected here, from Byzantine,
Bulgarian, and Bosnian sources, regarding the tenets of the more
Eastern heretics, might be paralleled by citations from Latin
chronicles,<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> touching those who broke the harmony of Western
Christendom. Enough if, while describing the belief and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlv"></a>[xlv]</span>
observances of the Bogomiles in Bosnia and Bulgaria, we have
alluded, here and there, to such striking similarities in the
details of church ministration and observances as show that the
more Western sectaries clung to their original Bulgarian model
in its minutest particulars. The doctrinal differences themselves
which afflicted the more Western offshoots of the heresy
had, as we have seen, their roots in a Bulgarian, perhaps an
Armenian, soil.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Bulgarian elders sat in Provençal synods,
Provençal bishops consulted with Bosnian Djeds on matters of
faith. To the orthodox Sclave or Byzantine, there were only
Bogomiles in the Languedoc, and the Romish hierarchy named
the heretics of Bosnia from a suburb of Milan.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> ‘The believers
of the plains of Lombardy and the South of France,’ to quote<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlvi"></a>[xlvi]</span>
the words of the recent Bohemian historian of Bulgaria, ‘kept up
a regular intercourse with their co-religionists in the Byzantine
Empire, Bosnia and Bulgaria, and long before the capture of
Constantinople by the Crusaders or the Turks, a mighty but
secret interchange of thought was at work between East and
West.’<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>It was during the reign of Culin that this great Puritan
movement attained its widest dimensions, and it is from a contemporary
of his, the Italian Reniero Sacconi, who from a
heretic became an inquisitor, that we obtain the most satisfactory
evidence as to the organization of this early Protestant
Church, and the solidarity of its various members, Sclavonic,
Greek, Romance, and Teutonic. The Church of the Cathari, as
he calls them, numbered then as many as thirteen bishoprics,
amongst which that of Bosnia or ‘Slavonia’ was not the least
important. By Culin’s time, the Bogomilian missionaries had
succeeded in disseminating their Armenian doctrines from Philippopolis
to Bordeaux, and had formed, if we may so term it, a
middle kingdom of their own—a Lotharingia of heterodoxy, extending
in an unbroken zone through the centre of orthodox
Europe, from the Black Sea to the Atlantic. Nay, the ark of
the faithful, borne northwards and westwards on the free bosom
of the Rhine, had crossed the Channel, and penetrated, as it were
by our great English river, to the seat of English learning; and
at the very time when Protestant Christendom looked to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlvii"></a>[xlvii]</span>
Ban of Bosnia as its chief protector, his Angevin contemporary,
our Henry II., was branding Paulicians at Oxford.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>Rapid and astonishing as was the spread of these Oriental
doctrines through Latin Christendom, there seems no difficulty
in accounting for it when we remember the missionary zeal
which the Sclavonic Bogomiles had inherited from their Armenian
teachers, and which led them, as we have seen, to set apart
funds for the support of Gospellers among unbelievers. The
same impulses which planted an Armenian faith among the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlviii"></a>[xlviii]</span>
Sclaves are sufficient to account for the success with which the
new converts acclimatized what was now a Sclavonic faith
amongst Greeks and Latins. It is certain that the Bulgarian
propaganda made use of existing trade-routes by land and sea.
This indeed is not the place to enquire what part Bulgaria and
what part Bosnia, what part the Save, the Danube and the
Rhine, the Po or the Adige, the commercial currents of the
Adriatic and the Mediterranean—what part Durazzo and the
Egnatian Way, what part Byzantium and Byzantine Lower Italy,
may have severally and collectively played in conveying the
Bogomilian heresy to Toulouse,<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> Milan and Cologne. On the
whole the Bosnian influence may be regarded as later and
secondary. It is probable that the first wave of propagandism
was almost entirely Bulgarian, and followed in the wake of Greek
merchantmen. The great part played by Bosnia was rather
that of asylum for the persecuted, and promoter of the faith, in
days when heresy had been stamped out elsewhere with fire and
sword. We have, however, precise data as to the Bogomilian
religion having been communicated to Dalmatia through commercial
relations with the interior of Bosnia,<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> and doubtless,
just as the Bulgarians, the South-Easternmost of the Sclavonic
races of the Balkan peninsula, first received their Manichæan
Puritanism from Armenia and the East, so the Bosnians, the
North-Westernmost<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> of the Balkan Sclaves, played at least a
part in first communicating it to Europe and the West.</p>

<p>It is from the pen of a St. Alban’s monk, and a letter of a
bishop of Porto, that we gain the most convincing testimony as to
the influence which, in the palmy days of Ban Culin, and the period
immediately succeeding, was exercised by Bosnia in directing
the great Protestant movement in Western Europe. Matthew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xlix"></a>[xlix]</span>
Paris<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> relates that the Albigensians of Provence and Italy possessed
a pope of their own, who resided in Bosnia.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> This man created
a vicar ‘in partibus Galliarum.’ The vicar of this Bosnian
anti-pope, who resided at Toulouse, granted him some lands at a
place called Porlos, and the Albigensian heretics betook themselves
to their Bosnian pope to consult him on divers questions of faith.
Matthew Paris and Ralph of Coggeshale are certainly wrong
in converting this Bosnian elder into an anti-pope, and his vicar
into the parody of an orthodox bishop,<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> hierarchy of any sort
being, as we have seen, alien to the spirit of the Bogomilian as
well as to the Albigensian sectaries. Yet it is quite possible
that a kind of informal primacy was at this time accorded to
the Bosnian <i>Djed</i>, and he may have fulfilled such moderating
functions, as interpreter in matters doctrinal, as seem to have
devolved, a century before, on the ‘heresiarch’ Basil. The fact
that this vicar had been originally sent to the Albigenses by the
Illyrian ‘antipope’ is a convincing proof of the direct missionary
connection between Bosnia and Provence, and the whole
incident shows that in the thirteenth century the Western
heretics still looked to the Slavonic East for the sources of true
belief.</p>

<p>It was in vain that on Culin’s death the King of Hungary
appointed a Catholic Ban Zibisclave. It was in vain that
in 1216 the Pope sent the sub-deacon Aconcius to labour at
the conversion of the heretics. The Bogomiles only gained
strength, and their faith struck firmer roots in the neighbouring
countries of Croatia, Dalmatia, Istria, Carniola, and Slavonia.
But Rome, in the Albigensian crusades, had already tasted Christian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_l"></a>[l]</span>
blood, and resolved to have recourse to the same weapons
in Bosnia which she had employed so efficaciously in Provence. An
Archbishop of Colocz was at hand to play the part of the Abbot
of Citeaux. In 1222 he entered Bosnia at the head of an Hungarian
host, and used the sword with such good effect that he had
shortly possessed himself of the provinces of ‘Bosna, Ussora, and
Soy.’ Zibisclav, who had defected from the true faith, saw himself
reduced to abjure his errors and to fling himself at the toes
of St. Peter, and the Pope was graciously pleased ‘to embrace
sincerely in the arms of his charity both his person and his
lands, and all the goods that he at the present possessed.’<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> But
Zibisclav’s subjects were not inclined to follow the example of
their Ban. On the contrary, they hardened their hearts, and in
the very year, 1233, in which this fond embrace took place, a
Bogomilian ‘pope’ or bishop continued to flourish and exercise
a powerful authority in Bosnia. A new crusade was necessary.
Coloman, the brother of the King of Hungary,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> was the De Montfort
of the occasion, and in 1238 entered Bosnia with a large army
to exterminate the heretics. He extended his havoc through the
whole country, and even ‘purged,’ we are told, the principality of
Chelm, which answers to the south-western part of the Herzegovina.
From this period onwards the history of Bosnia for centuries
consists of little more than a series of such bloody inroads; but
there are here none of those details which secure for the heretics
of Alby the commiseration of mankind. Cities are sacked, but
there is not here a Beziers or Carcassonne; the first germs of a
civilization are trodden under foot, but these are not the full-blown
roses of Provence; troubadours of a kind there doubtless
were here, too, but it was in barbarous Sclavonic tongue, and
not in the polished <i>Langue d’Oc</i> that they poured forth ‘their
unpremeditated lay,’ and the sound of their lyre died away among
the mountains that gave them birth.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_li"></a>[li]</span></p>

<p>Gregory IX. congratulates Coloman on ‘wiping out the
heresy and restoring the light of Catholic purity,’<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> but the
Pope was quick in discovering that these congratulations were
premature. The Tartar invasion which in 1241 weakened
Hungary was the strength of the Bogomiles of Bosnia. Nor,
perhaps, did the slaughter of Ban Zibisclav and many of his
bravest adherents by the horde of Khan Ugadai much affect
the subjects whose creed and interests he had deserted. In
1246 Pope Innocent IV.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> had to stir up a third Bosnian crusade,
the conduct of which was entrusted to the Archbishop of
Colocz—‘a man skilled,’ as was fitting in an archbishop, ‘in all
the science of war.’ He received a cross from the Pope to fix
upon his heart, and aided by the King Bela, of Hungary, renewed
the pious work. Many heretics were butchered, others
were cast into dungeons; and so great were considered the
deserts of the archbishop, that the Pope transferred the church
of Bosnia from Spalato to Colocz. But once more it was discovered
that fire and sword had raged in vain. Heresy continued
to be so rampant in Bosnia that from 1256 the episcopate of
Bosnia, which had been renewed after the first crusade, lapses a
second time.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> The papacy next resorted to persuasion, the more
so as during the last part of the thirteenth century the Hungarian
suzerainty was becoming less and less binding on Bosnia.
About the year 1260 the Minorite brothers of the order of St.
Francis of Assisi were sent into Bosnia to aid the Dominicans, who
had been already established here.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> At the end of the thirteenth
century Bosnia passed for a while under the overlordship of the
Prince of Serbia, and Stephen Dragutine, who was favourable
to the Roman church, allowed two Franciscan brothers to
establish the Inquisition here in 1291.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>But at the beginning of the fourteenth century the Hungarians
had once more recovered their ascendency in Bosnia,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lii"></a>[lii]</span>
and the Pope eagerly seized the weapon of orthodoxy at his service.
John XXII. directed two letters, one to Charles, King
of Hungary, and the other to Stephen, Ban of Bosnia. The
letters are almost identical in scope, and are interesting as
showing that Bosnia was still the stronghold and asylum of
European heresy, and as illustrating the peculiar character of
these sectaries. The letter to the Bosnian Ban is dated Avignon,
June 1325.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> ‘To our beloved son and nobleman, Stephen,
Prince of Bosnia,’—‘Knowing that thou art a faithful son of
the church, we therefore charge thee to exterminate the heretics
in thy dominions, and to render aid and assistance unto Fabian,
our Inquisitor, for as much as a large multitude of heretics, from
many and divers parts collected, hath flowed together into the
principality of Bosnia, trusting there to sow their obscene errors
and to dwell there in safety. These men, imbued with the
cunning of the Old Fiend, and armed with the venom of their
falseness, corrupt the minds of Catholics by outward show of
simplicity and lying assumption of the name of Christians;
their speech crawleth like a crab, and they creep in with humility,
but in secret they kill, and are wolves in sheeps’ clothing,
covering their bestial fury as a means whereby they may
deceive the simple sheep of Christ.’</p>

<p>The true believers still need to be warned against the apparent
meekness and innocence of these men of the gospel!
His Holiness seems almost to be repeating the description of the
Bogomiles given by the Bulgarian Presbyter over three centuries
before. ‘When men,’ says Cosmas, ‘see their lowly behaviour,
then think they that they are of true belief; they approach
them therefore and consult them about their souls’ health. But
they, like wolves that will swallow up a lamb, bow their head,
sigh, and answer full of humility, and set themselves up as if they
knew how it is ordered in heaven.’<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Hypocritical meekness has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_liii"></a>[liii]</span>
been a ready accusation in the mouths of opponents of puritanism
in all ages; but we may be allowed to see, in the slanders
of foul-mouthed popes and prelates, a tribute to the evangelic
purity of the lives of those whom they persecuted and traduced.</p>

<p>Once more ‘the Lilies of the Field,’ as in their figurative
parlance they loved to style themselves, are trampled under foot.
In 1330 the King of Hungary and the Ban combined to
assist the Inquisitor Fabian; many heretics were hounded from
the realm, and the usual scenes of horror were repeated. In
1337, however, heresy is again as rampant as ever in Bosnia,
and the Pope accordingly stirred up the neighbouring princes
to another Bosnian crusade, which was only averted by the
address of the Ban Stephen.</p>

<p>Sometimes the monks condescended to work miracles to forward
the work of conversion. One, while addressing a congregation
of heretics, ‘stepped,’ we are assured, ‘into a large fire, and
with great hilarity stood in the middle of the flames while he
recited the fiftieth Psalm.’ We hardly need the further assurance
that many were turned from the error of their ways by
miracles like this, especially when it is remembered that the
heretics had the alternative of repenting, or repeating the experiment.</p>

<p>Nor were there wanting, we are told, miraculous tokens in
the sky to manifest the displeasure of heaven itself at these
scoffers at Catholic verity. The mountains whither the Bogomiles
had been driven by the pious zeal of Ban Stephen were
struck by celestial fire. ‘Upon the eve of St. Catharine, 1367,
a mighty heavenly flame appeared in the East, with an intense
light terribly apparent to the whole globe. At that time they
say that the loftiest mountains of Bosnia, with all rocks, cattle,
wild beasts, and fowls of the air, were miraculously consumed,
so that they were reduced to a plain; and there dwell the
Patarene Manichæans, and say that God burnt up those mountains
for their convenience, because He loved their faith.’<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> In
fact, neither the Bogomiles nor the new Ban Stephen Tvartko,
who favoured them, seem to have been the least appalled by
this phenomenon. Only two years after this miraculous conflagration,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_liv"></a>[liv]</span>
Urban V. writes to the King of Hungary to complain of
the Ban of Bosnia, ‘who, following in the detestable footsteps
of his fathers, fosters and defends the heretics who flow together
into these parts from divers corners of the world as into a sink of
iniquity.’<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> The Bans of Bosnia, even when Catholics themselves,
seem to have been forced by the strength of national feeling
into an attitude at least of toleration towards the Bogomiles,
and their position in this respect has been aptly compared by
Hilferding to that of the Bulgarian Czars.</p>

<p>During the troublous times of the Bosnian kingdom the
Bogomiles increased in strength, and, what is extremely significant,
the heretics of Bosnia begin to play a part in the revival
of the Protestant movement throughout Europe. We do not
know what part the Sclavonic heretics of Bosnia may have taken
in preparing the minds of their Czechian brothers for the
religious revolt of which Huss and Jerome of Prague were the
leaders and exponents. But we do know that from the first
intimate relations existed between the Bogomiles of Bosnia and
the Hussites; in 1433 four Bogomilian or Patarene bishops
made their way from Bosnia to the Council of Basil,<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> and
shortly after, in 1437, the Romish bishop Joseph complains
that Bosnia was swarming with Hussites and other heretics.
We have, moreover, very strong indirect evidence that the
movement in Bosnia was at this time directed by men of learning
and ability. In 1462 Pius II., being much alarmed at the
progress of heresy in Bosnia, and ‘hearing that there was a
great want there of men skilled in philosophy, the sacred canons,
and theology,’ sent thither ‘learned men from the neighbouring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lv"></a>[lv]</span>
provinces,’ and especially the brother Peter de Mili, a native of
Bosnia, and four fellows. These five ‘had studied in the best
Cismontane and Transmontane Universities under the most
learned doctors.’ The Pope, moreover, gave orders that some
of the largest convents should be converted into schools for
literary studies.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> We may conclude with confidence that learning
was required in Bosnia to cope with learning.</p>

<p>But the preparation of this polemic artillery was cut short
by an event, the effects of which are even now distracting
Christendom. In the year following that in which his Holiness
laments over the continued progress of heresy in Bosnia, the
whole country passed in the short space of eight days irrevocably
under the dominion of the Infidel. The continued crusades,
the persecutions of the Inquisition—fire, sword, exile, and
dungeon—had done their work. The Protestant population of
Bosnia had at last deliberately taken its choice, and preferred
the dominion of what it believed to be the more tolerant Turks
to the ferocious tyranny of Catholic kings, magnates, and monks.
There never was a clearer instance of the Nemesis which follows
on the heels of religious persecution. Europe has mainly to
thank the Church of Rome that an alien civilisation and religion
has been thrust into her midst, and that Bosnia at the present
day remains Mahometan.</p>

<p>At the very moment when the Turks were threatening the
existence of the Bosnian kingdom, the King, then Stephen
Tomašević, and priests, aided by the magnates and aristocratic
party in the State, were pushing the persecution of the Bogomiles
to an extreme which perhaps it had never reached before.
In the year 1459 King Stephen turned his feudal arms against
the inoffensive Bogomiles at home, and hounded out as many,
it is said,<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> as forty thousand, who took refuge in the Herzegovina,
with their co-religionist, the Duke of St. Sava. Others
he sent in chains to Rome, where it appears they were ‘benignantly
converted’—whatever that means. But the expulsion
of forty thousand did little to diminish the strength of the
Bogomiles in Bosnia. In 1462, as we know from the Roman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lvi"></a>[lvi]</span>
archives, heresy was as powerful as ever in Bosnia. Already,
twelve years before,<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> the Bogomiles had invited the Turks into
Bosnia as their deliverers; in 1463 the invitation was repeated,
a successful negotiation was opened with the Sultan, and, on
Mahomet II.’s invasion, the Catholic king found himself deserted
by his people. The keys of the principal fortress, the royal city
of Bobovac, were handed over to the Turk by the ‘Manichæan’
governor;<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> the other fortresses and towns hastened to imitate
its example, and within a week ‘seventy cities defended by
nature and art’ passed into the hands of Mahomet. Bosnia,
which may be described as one vast stronghold, refused to strike
a blow in defence of her priestly tyrants.</p>

<p>Perhaps enough has been said to show the really important
part played by Bosnia in European history. We have seen her aid
in interpreting to the West the sublime puritanism which the
more Eastern Sclaves of Bulgaria had first received from the
Armenian missionaries. We have seen her take the lead in the
first religious revolt against Rome. We have seen a Bosnian
religious teacher directing the movement in Provence. We have
seen the Protestants of Bosnia successfully resisting all the
efforts of Rome, supported by the arms of Hungary, to put
them down. We have seen them offering an asylum to their
persecuted brothers of the West,—Albigensians, Patarenes, and
Waldenses. We have seen them connected with the Reformation
in Bohemia, and affording shelter to the followers of Huss.
From the twelfth century to the final conquest of the Turks in
the sixteenth, when the fight of religious freedom had been won
in Northern Europe, Bosnia presents the unique phenomenon of
a Protestant State existing within the limits of the Holy Roman
Empire, and in a province claimed by the Roman Church.
Bosnia was the religious Switzerland of Mediæval Europe, and
the signal service which she has rendered to the freedom of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lvii"></a>[lvii]</span>
the human intellect by her successful stand against authority
can hardly be exaggerated. Resistance, broken down in the
gardens of Provence, buried beneath the charred rafters of the
Roman cities of the Langue d’Oc, smothered in the dungeons of
the Inquisition, was prolonged from generation to generation
amongst the primeval forests and mountain fastnesses of Bosnia.
There were not wanting, amongst those who sought to exterminate
the Bogomiles, Churchmen as dead to human pity as the
Abbot of Citeaux, and lay arms as bloodthirsty as De Montfort;
but the stubborn genius of the Serbian people fought on with
rare persistence, and held out to the end. The history of these
champions of a purer religion has been written by their enemies,
and ignored by those who owe most to their heroism. No
Martyrology of the Bogomiles of Bosnia has come down to us.
We have no Huss or Tyndale to arrest our pity. ‘Invidious
silence’ has obscured their fame,</p>

<p class="noindent">Protestant historians, fearful of claiming relationship with heretics
whose views on the Origin of Evil were more logical than
their own, have almost or entirely ignored the existence of these
Sclavonic Puritans. Yet of all worn-out devices of <i>ad captandum</i>
argument this assuredly is the most threadbare, to ignore the transitions
of intervening links, and pointing to the extremes of a long
concatenation of causes and effects, to seize upon their differences
as a proof of disconnection. In the course of ages the development
of creeds and churches is not less striking than that of more
secular institutions. Bogomilism obeyed an universal law; it
paid the universal tribute of successful propagandism; it compromised;
or, where it did not compromise, it was ruthlessly
stamped out. The Manichæan elements, most distasteful to
modern Protestants, were in fact the first to disappear.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> In its
contact with the semi-pagan Christianity of the West, the puritanism<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lviii"></a>[lviii]</span>
of the Gnostic East became, perforce, materialized; just
as, ages before, Christianity itself, an earlier wave of the same
Eastern puritanism had materialized in its contact with the undiluted
heathendom of the Western empire. To a certain extent
Bogomilism gained. It lost something of its dreamy transcendentalism,
something of its anti-human vigour, and by conforming to
the exigencies of Western society, became to a certain extent
more practical. Thus by the sixteenth century the path had
been cleared for a compromise with orthodoxy itself. The Reformation
marks the confluence of the two main currents of religious
thought that traverse the middle ages, in their several sources,
Romish and Armenian. No doubt, from the orthodox side,
which refused to reject all that was beautiful in the older world,
which consecrated Greco-Roman civilization and linked art
with religion, the West has gained much; but in days of gross
materialism and degrading sacerdotalism, it has gained perhaps
even more from the purging and elevating influence of these
early Puritans. The most devout Protestant need not be afraid
to acknowledge the religious obligations which he owes to his
spiritual forefathers, Manichæan though they were; while those
who perceive in Protestantism itself nothing more than a stepping-stone
to still greater freedom of the human mind, and who
recognize the universal bearings of the doctrine of Evolution,
will be slow to deny that England herself and the most enlightened
countries of the modern world may owe a debt, which
it is hard to estimate, to the Bogomiles of Bulgaria and Bosnia.</p>

<p>After the Turkish conquest of Bosnia the history of the
Bogomiles in those parts becomes obscure. That they still
existed in the revived Banat of lower Bosnia we may gather
from a passage in the ‘Annals of the Minorites,’<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> to the effect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lix"></a>[lix]</span>
that in 1478 the city of Jaycze was ‘polluted by heretics and
schismatics.’ Many who had resisted the propaganda of Rome
appear to have found in the iconoclastic puritanism of Islâm a
belief less incompatible with their own. We have direct evidence
that it was the Bogomiles who chiefly swelled the ranks
of the renegades.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Many, doubtless, when they found how hard
were the masters they had called in, were provoked to their old
attitude of resistance, and perished for their obstinacy. They
are generally said to have died out, and the Bosnian monks of
the order of St. Francis, who, in 1769, supplied the author of
‘Illyricum Sacrum’ with an account of the present state of
that country, declare that there are no traces left of them. This,
however, is not the case. During the recent insurrection, over
2,000 Bogomiles from Popovo, a single district of the Herzegovina,
took refuge in the hospitable territory of what was once
the Republic of Ragusa.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lx"></a>[lx]</span></p>

<p>To return to the more secular aspects of Bosnian history.
Much still remains to be elucidated by Sclavonic historians with
regard to the inner government of the country, the rise of the
semi-feudal nobility, and the complicated relations of parties.
Here it would be hopeless to attempt anything more than the
merest outline, giving prominence only to a few episodes of
general interest. The Hungarian overlordship is occasionally
broken by a Serbian, and Stephen Dūshan, who, in the middle of
the fourteenth century, revived the Czardom among the Balkan
Sclaves, seized the pretext of a claim on the Principality of
Chelm to overrun Bosnia, and add its dominion to his titles.
For an interesting monument of this period I may refer the
reader to the account of the Book of Arms of Bosnian Nobility,
drawn up in the year 1340 by order of the Serbian Czar, which
we saw in the Franciscan Monastery of Foinica.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>But this Serbian suzerainty vanishes with the dreams of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxi"></a>[lxi]</span>
Stephen Dūshan. Shortly after his date the Bans of Bosnia
become so powerful that they are able to annex the two important
Serbian provinces of Rascia and Zenta, which answers
to the modern Montenegro, and to proclaim themselves virtually
independent both of the Serbian and Hungarian monarchies.
In 1376 the Ban, Stephen Tvartko, was strong enough
to extort from his uncle, King Louis of Hungary, permission to
assume the royal style—the King of Hungary only reserving the
<i>suprema dominatio</i>.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> After half a year spent in preparations,
Tvartko, accompanied by his lords spiritual and temporal,
and by four representatives from each important town, progressed
from his residence of Sutiska to the Monastery of Mileševo, the
foundation and burial-place of his uncle and predecessor, but the
greater glory of which was that it contained the tomb of the
Serbian Apostle, St. Sava. There he was crowned by the hands
of the Metropolitan, and assumed the title of Stephen Tvartko,
by the grace of God King of Rascia, Bosnia, and Primorie.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a></p>

<p>Stephen Tvartko distinguished his rule by his wisdom and
toleration. Though himself leaning in his belief alternately
to Greek orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism, he displayed a
generous toleration of the Bogomiles; he did much to encourage
trade and commerce, and was indeed, after Culin, the first Bosnian
prince who struck coins.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> He succeeded in quelling the
insolence of his great nobles who had burst out into rebellion,
under the leadership of his brother, and the attendance at his coronation
of four representatives from each of his great cities would
alone be a striking proof that Bosnia was advancing on the path
of constitutional liberty, and was not by any means alien to the
civic and industrial impulses of fourteenth-century Europe.
Nay, it is certain that, in spite of the prevalence of Bogomilism
among the masses, and of the artistically blighting influence of
an iconoclastic religion on a rude society, arts of a more
æsthetic kind were penetrating among the Bosnian mountains.
Nor was it only in the illuminations of heraldry, the embellishment
of gold and silver work, and the superb embroidery of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxii"></a>[lxii]</span>
sacred vestments that these more refined influences asserted themselves.
That munificent patron of South-Sclavonic Art, the present
Roman Catholic bishop of Bosnia, has collected in his palace
of Diakovar, a series of paintings by Bosnian artists of this and
the succeeding century, which reflect the Giottesque revulsion
from the wooden Byzantinism which preceded it, and show that
Bosnia bade fair to produce a school of artists who might hold
a place in the galleries of Europe.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>

<p><i>Dîs aliter placitum!</i> Already, through the passes of the
Balkan the storm was howling nearer and nearer that was to
annihilate the budding gems of culture and free government
in Bosnia. In 1353,—five years before Tvartko’s accession to the
Banat,—under Suleiman, the son of Orchan, the Turks had first
set foot in Europe. In twelve more years their ravages had
spread to Attica, the Palæologi had pawned their crown
jewels, and the Turkish Sultan had transferred his residence
from Broussa to Adrianople. The tide of invasion poured along
the Pontic shores, across the plains of Thrace, and was bursting
through the iron gates of Hæmus. The Crescent already floated
on the holy city of Bulgaria, the Marica had run red with the
blood of Serbian chivalry, and turbaned warriors had scaled
the salt steppes of Albania; the people, in the plaintive words
of their heroic poetry, ‘were scattered abroad like the fowls of
the air,’ and Macedonia was resigned to wolves and vultures.
Meanwhile, Bulgaria, already half conquered, was split up into
the two rival Czardoms of Tirnovo and Widdin; Serbia, by the
death of Czar Dūshan, had lost the one man capable of restraining
anarchy at home, or of marshalling the forces of the nation
against the Turkish invaders, and the great empire of the
Némanjas had shivered into a hundred fragments.</p>

<p>Thus it was that in the hour of disunion and despair Serb
and Bulgar alike turned to the new and rising kingdom that their
Bosnian kinsmen had established in the Illyrian West. Tvartko<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxiii"></a>[lxiii]</span>
was now at the height of his power, and included under his sceptre
more extensive dominions than any Bosnian Ban, or King,
before or after. He had seized the land of Chelm, the later Herzegovina,
which had belonged to former Bans of Bosnia, till exchanged
for Primorie with the King of Hungary; and added
to it the two old Serbian Župas of Canali<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> and Tribunja; he had
extended at least a suzerainty over the Principality of Zenta or
the Black-Mountain; and by 1382 appears to have reduced the
whole of Dalmatia, with the single exception of the city of Zara.
Tvartko ruled already from beyond the Drina to the islands of
the Adriatic, and from the Save to the lake of Skodra, but his
ambition aimed at nothing short of re-establishing the empire
of the Balkan Sclaves under a Bosnian sceptre, and of ruling, it
might be, over wider realms than the greatest of the Némanjas.
For these mighty schemes not only did he seem qualified by his
personal abilities, but by connection and descent. His first wife,
Dorothea, was the daughter of the Bulgarian Czar, Sracimir of
Widdin; on his mother’s side he traced his descent from Stephen
Dragutin; and, on the extinction of the Némanjids, claimed to be
the rightful heir of the Serbian Kings and Czars.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> In Croatia he
had allied himself with the nobility in their opposition to their
Hungarian suzerain, with the object of incorporating that province
in his own dominions, and extending his frontier to the
Drave.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Thus the appeal of the Sclavonic princes, Serbian and
Bulgarian, who felt themselves powerless to repel the Turks, not
only roused the Bosnian King to a sense of his own impending
danger, but flattered his ambition. He hastened to respond to
the appeal, by gathering an army of 30,000 men and advancing
in person against the Infidel. For a moment that fatal spell of
isolation which had held Bosnia so long aloof from the fortunes
of neighbouring and kindred people is broken through, and she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxiv"></a>[lxiv]</span>
stands forth against the Turks at the head of a great confederacy
of the Southern Sclaves, whose members were scattered
from Silistria to Durazzo, and from Thessalonica to Belgrade.
Joining his forces to the Serbian host collected by the ill-starred
Knez Lazar, King Tvartko took advantage of the
absence of Sultan Amurath in Asia, to fall upon his army near
Pločnik on the Toplica, and inflicted on it such an annihilating
defeat that scarce a fifth escaped the sword or captivity.</p>

<p>Amurath was furious, and hurried from Asia to avenge the
disaster. Tirnovo fell, and the sight of a captive Czar struck
terror into the Bulgarians. Tvartko despatched an army under
his brave General, Vlatko Hranić, to the aid of the Sclavonic
confederates, and for the last time Bosniac, Serb, Croat, and
Bulgarian, joined their forces against the Infidel. Only two
years after the rout of Pločnik, on June 15, St. Vitus’ day, 1389,
on the ill-omened field of Kóssovo was fought one of the great
battles of the world, decisive even in its indecisiveness.</p>

<p>Nothing but a brilliant victory could have galvanized into unity
the ill-compacted alliance of the Sclaves. We need not dwell upon
the incidents of the fight.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> How the hero Miloš met the wassail
taunts of treachery by rushing to his doom and stabbing ‘the
Turkish Czar Murad’ in his pavilion; how the head of the Serbian
Knez Lazar was held aloft by its grey hairs to glut the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxv"></a>[lxv]</span>
glazing eyes of the Turkish Sultan; how the Bosnian Voivode,
metamorphosed into his Herzegovinian successor,—‘ducal
Stephen,’ struck down nine Pashàs and sank himself before the
tenth; of the lightning charge of Bajazet, the thunder-stroke of
his iron mace, the crowning treachery of Vuk; or how, long
afterwards, the Serbian wayfarers on the Field of Thrushes found
the body of their sainted King, and Knez Lazar was borne
at last by priestly hands ‘to beauteous Ravanica in the mountain
forest,’ there to lie amidst his kindred in the convent of his
rearing: all this, with many a legendary aftergrowth, lives as fresh
in the minds of the Southern Sclaves as if it were of yesterday.
There is not a name in that heroic muster-roll which is not a
household word wherever the Serbian tongue is spoken. Epic
lays of the fatal day of Kóssovo are still sung every day to
throngs of peasant listeners by minstrels of the people, whose
rhapsodies, set to the dolorous strains of the ghuzla, resound in
a great national dirge along the willowed banks of Save and
Danube, through the beechwood glens of Bosnia, the dark recesses
of the Balkan, the mountain strongholds of the Czernagora,
till, far away across the Illyrian desert, they find an echo in that
caverned waste of rock that frowns above the blue waters of the
Adriatic. The battle of Kóssovo has grown and grown on the
imagination of oppressed peoples who only realized its full significance
long afterwards. Tragic and romantic as were the actual
incidents of that great contest, they stand out against the disastrous
twilight that succeeded, in fantastic and supernatural
relief, lit up by the lurid conflagrations of after ravages. At the
time, we have the most direct evidence that the battle was regarded
by one at least of the principal actors as a great victory
for Christendom. Amurath was slain, the Turks had retired
from the field of battle, and the brave Bosnian General had returned
to his sovereign with unbroken forces. Tvartko wrote
word to the citizens of Traù and Florence that he had once more
triumphed over the Infidel, and Te Deums of thanksgiving for
the success of the Christian arms were celebrated in the cathedral
of Notre Dame and in the presence of the king of France.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxvi"></a>[lxvi]</span>
the death-knell of the Serbians and Bulgarians had already
sounded, the last confederacy of the Southern Sclaves was broken
up, the imperial aspirations of the Bosnian King were dashed
for ever, and the doom of Bosnia itself was but postponed.</p>

<p>The battle of Kóssovo was the turning-point in Tvartko’s
fortunes. His intrigues in Croatia, and a victory obtained over
the Hungarian arms in Dalmatia, roused the Magyar King,
Sigismund, to vengeance, and Tvartko, prevented himself by
bodily weakness from taking an active part in the hostilities,
saw his allies defeated, his province of Ussora overrun,<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> and himself
reduced to renew his homage.</p>

<p>In 1391 Tvartko dies, of vexation, it is said, at these reverses,
and is succeeded by Stephen Dabiscia, otherwise known as
Tvartko II., and he again in 1396 by Tvartko III.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> The
greater part of the long reign of this King, which lasted forty-seven
years, is distracted by perpetual wars, connected with the
disputed succession of the Hungarian crown. It is extremely
difficult to trace out the aims of the different parties who are
now disputing for mastery in Bosnia. At one time Tvartko III.,
who seems, like his father, Tvartko I., to have aimed at Croatian
annexations, appears at the head of an insurrection of Bosnian
and Croatian magnates against Sigismund of Hungary, and in
1408 is defeated and captured under the walls of his historic
Castle of Doboj,<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> where the conqueror executed 180 Bosnian
and Croatian nobles. Tvartko, though forced to resume his
allegiance, was suffered to retain his crown, and for many
years we find him maintaining his position in league with
the party of Sigismund among the Magyars, and generally by
the support of the Bogomiles, and the popular party who
seem to be identical with them. When the Magnates and their
auxiliaries of the Neapolitan and Dalmatian faction sought
to oppose him and set up a rival king, Tvartko carried
out his national policy still further by sending a message
to Vladislaus Jagellon, the Polish claimant of the Hungarian
throne, in which he offered him his homage and begged for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxvii"></a>[lxvii]</span>
assistance on the plea of the common origin of the Poles and
Bosniacs.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<p>In this universal confusion the Turks first make good a footing
in Bosnia. Already in the reign of Stephen Dabiscia, Bajazet
had advanced into the county of Chelm and established stationary
quarters at a spot become memorable in the most recent
times as the scene of the first outbreak of a revolt which has
shaken Turkish dominion in Bosnia to its foundations—Nevešinje.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>
But in the factious contests which distracted the reign of
the third Tvartko, each of the competitors for dominion outbade
the other for Turkish help, and it was by the direct invitation
and under the actual leadership of a turbulent noble that
the Turks first gained sufficient footing in Bosnia to establish
there a Sandjakate. The whole story is worth repeating, as it
singularly illustrates the state into which this unhappy country
had fallen. At the time there were two kings in Bosnia; Tvartko,
who had now made his peace with Sigismund and ruled over
the parts of Bosnia along the Drina and the Serbian frontier,
and Ostoja, who owed his elevation to the Neapolitan faction
of Ladislaus, and whose territory embraced the maritime parts
and a tract roughly answering to the later Herzegovina. Between
the Eastern and the Western kingdom lay a more or less
neutral wedge of country which had been carved out by
King Sigismund and formed into a Hungarian Banat under the
great Croatian noble Hervoja Horvatić, whose dominion included
the city of Jaycze, and anticipated in its extent that
Banat of lower Bosnia which, at a later time, Mathias Corvinus
recovered from the Turkish conqueror. Hervoja, who assumed
the title of Chief Voivode, and even Prince, of Bosnia,<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> and
who shifted his allegiance, as the whim seized him, from Tvartko<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxviii"></a>[lxviii]</span>
and Sigismund to Ostoja and Ladislaus, happened on one occasion
to have honoured King Sigismund with his presence at his court.
Hervoja, who added a bullying manner to a body of bovine
dimensions, was haranguing the assembled magnates, Hungarian
and Bosnian, in his usual tones, when a certain Paul Chupor,
Ban of Slavonia, broke in upon his lordship by bellowing like a
bull. This was too much for the gravity of court ceremonial, and
King Sigismund himself could not help joining in the general
laugh. But Hervoja, in a frantic rage, left the court, and
hurried back to his Banat, vowing vengeance against the
Hungarian King, his Bosnian liegeman King Tvartko, and
every baron who followed their banners. Seizing the opportunity
when both of them were away in Germany, he called in
the Turks and took the command of the invading horde in
person. In the absence of the two Kings, the magnates of the
country, with his mortal enemy, Paul Chupor, at their head,
united their retainers to oppose him. Hervoja defeated their
army, and having the luck to take his old insulter prisoner, had
him sewn up alive in a bull’s hide and thrown into the river,
with the characteristic jest, ‘When thou wert a man thou didst
speak with a bull’s voice; take now thy bull’s hide as well!’</p>

<p>The Turks after devastating the country, destroying Varch
Bosna near the site of Serajevo and penetrating into the
district of Sala in lower Bosnia, refused this time to content
themselves with plunder, and established their first Sandjakate in
Bosnia. Hervoja, seeing himself thrown over by the Turks, who
found him no longer useful as a cat’s-paw, and deserted by his
own adherents, shut himself up in his family castle at Cattaro,
and worn with vexation, perhaps remorse, died the same summer.
The two Kings, Tvartko and Sigismund, succeeded on
their return in gaining a victory over the Turks, slaying the
Sandjak Ikach, and freeing Bosnia for a while from the occupation
of the Infidel. But the anarchy within continued, and in 1430
culminated in the spectacle of three rival princes, each of them
claiming to be King of Bosnia! In 1435 the death of his two
rivals left Tvartko III. once more sole king; but shortly after
that date the part of his dominions which answers to the modern
Herzegovina separates itself from the rest of Bosnia, and forms
for a while an independent principality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxix"></a>[lxix]</span></p>

<p>The County of Chelm, variously designated as the Banat of
Zachlumje and the land of Humska, had been originally incorporated
in the Banat of Bosnia by the Ban Stephen<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> in 1326.
We have seen it exchanged for Primorie with the King of Hungary,
and re-annexed by the first King of Bosnia, who granted
it as a fief to his brave general Vlatko Hranić. His grandson,
who from his birthplace Cosac, was known as Stephen Cosača, or
Cosaccia,<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> took advantage of the weakness of Tvartko III. to
transfer the immediate suzerainty of his county to the Emperor
Frederick IV., who in 1440 created him Duke, or, as his Sclavonic
subjects who had borrowed the German word expressed it,
<i>Herzega</i>, of St. Sava.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> This, and the further title of ‘Keeper
of St. Sava’s Sepulchre,’ he derived from the tomb of the patron
saint of Serbia in his monastery of Mileševo.</p>

<p>The Herzegovina, or Duchy, as this country now begins to
be called,<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> included, besides the old county of Chelm, the
coastland district known as Primorie, and extended from the
borders of Rascia to the neighbourhood of Zara.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Stephen
Cosaccia fixed as the seat of his government the important point
where the old Roman bridge still spans the river Narenta,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxx"></a>[lxx]</span>
and the City of Mostar still looks back to Radivoj Gost, his
<i>Curopalata</i> or ‘Mayor of the Palace,’ as its founder.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

<p>During the last years of Tvartko’s reign Bosnia enjoyed the
peace she so much needed. The King who had inherited many of
the good qualities, though not perhaps the martial ardour and
masterful ambition of his father, the first Tvartko, won the
hearts of his people by his even-handed justice. He heard complaints
himself, sitting in the gate, as the Prince of Montenegro
does at the present day, and decided the cases set before him
with wisdom. Before punishment could be inflicted on anyone
judgment had first to be pronounced by the Starosts or Elders
of the realm, and the verdict had first to be submitted to the
approval of the people. Business of state was conducted
by the King in Council, and his chief advisers were the Bans of
Jaycze and Bosna. In Tvartko’s days, we are told, no flatterer
dare approach the Court. The Bogomiles enjoyed toleration,
and Tvartko himself and the chief barons of the realm, including
the Count of Popovo and Trebinje, the despot George of
Serbia, and Sandalj Hranić were adherents of the sect. The
Franciscan Missionaries, to whom directly or indirectly a very
large share of the troubles of the Bosnian kingdom was due,
were confined to the districts where they were already settled,
and compelled to limit their exactions to a more restricted
sphere; Tvartko even profited by a quarrel that broke out between
them and the superior of their order, to place them under
his direct jurisdiction.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>Stephen Thomas succeeded Tvartko ‘the Just’ on the throne
of Bosnia in 1443. He was an illegitimate son of Ostoja and a
Ragusan lady, Voiacchia, and was raised to the throne by the
Bogomiles to whose communion he belonged. True to the policy
which prompted the Puritan population of Bosnia to seek a
counterpoise against Catholic Hungary in their fellow Puritans,
the champions of Islâm, King Stephen Thomas began his reign
by promising a yearly tribute to the Sultan. But the Papal
party had rightly reckoned on the weakness of Thomas’s character;
and the subtle genius of the Apostolic legate, Thomasini,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxxi"></a>[lxxi]</span>
whom the Pope had sent to effect his conversion, knew
only too well how to play upon his fears and cupidity. Stephen
Thomas was illegitimate; the lawful son of Ostoja, Radivoj (or
Gaudenzo) had returned from Turkish exile and put in a claim
on the Bosnian crown; the Papal party had powerful weapons at
their command in the Duke of St. Sava, then a staunch Catholic,
who refused allegiance and invaded Thomas’s territory, and in
the King of Hungary, who as suzerain, declined to recognize
the title of a heretic prince. Thomasini offered to legitimate
Thomas and his heirs, to obtain for him a consecrated crown, to
reconcile his rivals and his suzerain. The King of Bosnia
yielded, abjured his Bogomilian heresy, and was baptized into the
Catholic fold. Thomas, who had hitherto hesitated to take the
style of King in his official acts,<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> was formally crowned in 1444.
His homage was accepted by the Hungarian King Ladislaus,
and his rival Radivoj was pacified with the grant of the Banat
of Jaycze.</p>

<p>In Bosnia itself this abjuration of the national faith produced
the most deplorable effects. The Inquisition raised its
head, the Franciscans were again rampant. The Bogomiles saw
themselves betrayed by the King of their own creation. The
great vassal of the Bosnian crown, Stephen Cosaccia, Duke of
St. Sava, who in the first blush of Thomas’s conversion had been
induced to return to his allegiance, and whose goodwill had
been further courted by Thomas taking his daughter Catharine
to wife, now began to find it politic to cut himself adrift from
the Papal party, and to bid for complete independence of the
Bosnian Crown by posing as the protector of the Bogomiles.
Meanwhile, beyond the border, the great battle of Varna had
been fought, the Hungarians routed, and their King slain. As
the danger of Turkish conquest drew nearer and nearer, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxxii"></a>[lxxii]</span>
most bigoted champions of the Roman Church might see the
danger of throwing the Protestant population into the arms of
the invader; and the most sanguine of the Christian Puritans,
viewing the fate of their brothers in Bulgaria, might shrink from
accepting the dominion of their Mahometan counterparts. In
the Diet, or Great Council of the Realm, which King Stephen
Thomas assembled at Coinica, we may see a last effort to check
the growing anarchy, and unite the discordant elements of
the realm. I have given an account of the great charter of King
Stephen Thomas while describing the scene of the ‘Conventus’
of Coinica.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> In it the constitutional relation of the Duke of St.
Sava will be found defined, and the clause which enacts ‘that the
Manichæans build no new church nor restore the old,’ but which
omits to prescribe any further penalties or to fulminate any of
the usual anathemas against them, seems to me to imply that
even the Bogomiles were to be accorded comparative toleration.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
But passions ran too high, anarchy was too inveterate in Bosnia,
for this attempt at internal pacification to succeed. In the
Papal legate, Thomasini, King Stephen Thomas had ever
at his side an evil genius, who inclined him more and more
towards the path of persecution. With the Turk at the door
King Thomas, who was known to the Roman Catholics as the
‘pious,’ once more lent the support of the civil arm to the Inquisition.
The Bogomiles turned for protection to the Turks,
their only possible ally, and, four years after the ‘Conventus’ of
Coinica, invited them into the country. Stephen Thomas, a
tyrant towards his own subjects, showed himself a craven before
the foe, and purchased an ignominious peace from Amurath by
agreeing to pay him 25,000 ducats a year. But the Turkish
suzerainty became more and more galling, and the fall of Constantinople
in 1453 finally roused him from his lethargy. Four
years after that event he issued from his Palace of Sutisca, near
the Castle of Bobovac, an appeal to the whole Christian world<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxxiii"></a>[lxxiii]</span>
for help against the Infidel.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> This was addressed to the Pope,
the King of Arragon, the Doge of Venice, the Duke of Burgundy,
and other Christian princes. But the days of the Crusades
were gone by, and the appeal of the King of Bosnia met with
no response, save that the Pope sent him a consecrated standard
and a cross.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the death of the brave John Hunyadi, and the
paralysing civil war in Hungary, left the Bosnian King without
his one ally. The Turkish ravages now extended to the heart of
Bosnia. Already, in 1449, Turks were settled in the country
between the Drina and Ukrina stream,<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> on the main line of
communication between Bosnia and Hungary; now, the neighbouring
Pashàs and Agas begin to drive a regular traffic in
Bosnian slaves. A half mythical atmosphere surrounds the last
days of the Bosnian kingdom. It is said that the craven Thomas,
fearing to resist the Turks, entered into a secret league with
them. We are told by contemporary writers that Mahomet
himself, disguised as a Morabite, made his way in company
with two real members of that order, into the royal palace of
Sutiska,<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> that King Thomas showed him all honour, and solemnly
entered with him into that sworn brothership so hallowed
amongst the Southern Sclaves, the <i>Pobratimstvo</i>. Whether
such a meeting actually occurred, or whether the whole story
was the invention of domestic enemies, there can be no doubt
that the poltroonery and tergiversation of Thomas had alienated
even that Catholic faction on which since his abjuration of Bogomilism
he had relied. Signs of defection already appeared, and
the King turned the arms that he should have employed against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxxiv"></a>[lxxiv]</span>
the national enemy, to reduce a refractory Croatian vassal. It
was while besieging his castle, encamped on the field of Bielaj,
that King Stephen Thomas was assassinated, if report spoke truly,
by his step-brother Radivoj and his illegitimate son Stephen.</p>

<p>The parricide Stephen Tomašević at once usurped the
throne, though Stephen Thomas is often regarded by Bosnians
as their last king. The Catholic and anti-Turkish party were
now triumphant, and the new King began his reign by an
appeal to the feudal nobility of Bosnia to meet him with their retainers
equipped for battle against the Infidel, on the field of
Kóssovo. This summons is dated Pristina, June 3, 1459, and is
one of the last records of feudal Bosnia. The Barons, Prelates,
Nobles, Voivodes, and magnates of the realm,<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> are summoned by
name. The Župans<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> of Rascia and of Serbia, with their banners
and retainers, the Ban of Jaycze, the Ban of Ussora, the Duke of
St. Sava, and the lesser nobles, are marshalled before us on parchment.
The King appeals to their orthodox bigotry, and seems
to take an illustration from the fire-drakes of Sclavonic folk-lore.
‘What faithful Christian,’ he asks, ‘and zealous lover of the orthodox
faith can restrain his tears when considering the capture
of Constantinople?’ He calls on the Barons aforesaid ‘to meet
us on the field of Kóssovo in June, for we ought in a body to
advance against the dragon, lest he spit forth over us his venom.’<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
But King Stephen Tomašević inherited his father’s poltroonery,
with more than his father’s bigotry. We do not know that he
ever met the Turks at Kóssovo; but we know that this same
year he turned the arms of his orthodox Magnates against his
unoffending Bogomile subjects, and hounded 40,000 of them
from the realm. His brave generals, Paul Kubretić and Tomko
Mergnjavić, defended severally the line of the Drina and the
Rascian frontier with success, but the surrender of Semendria<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxxv"></a>[lxxv]</span>
which the Hungarians had intrusted to his safe-keeping, to the
Turks, had irritated Mathias Corvinus and the powerful Hungarian
faction among the Magnates, and this dissatisfaction was
intensified by Tomašević throwing himself and his kingdom at
the feet of the Papacy, which, however, wisely refused to accept
it. Meanwhile it was no secret that Mahomet was preparing
for his great invasion of Bosnia.</p>

<p>The King of Bosnia who had already secured the alliance of
the Venetians and Scanderbeg, turned once more to the Pope,
if not to gain him fresh allies, at least to sanctify his efforts,
and to breathe into his followers the enthusiasm of a new
crusade. The ambassadors of Tomašević appeared at Rome in
1463, and were received in solemn conclave by the Pope. They
read to him and the spiritual senators assembled an appeal
drawn up by the Bosnian King’s own hand. The speech, for it
is nothing less, has been preserved, and is the last monument
of Christian Bosnia. In turns it is argumentative, insinuating,
and solemn; selfish personal ambition is blended in a remarkable
way with a real appreciation of the gravity of the situation,
and the far-reaching consequences of a Turkish conquest of
Bosnia to Hungary and Christendom; and the King as he warms
with his harangue forgets the official plural of a royal style and
lapses into the impressive individuality of a prophet.</p>

<p>‘Most Holy Father, we, Stephen Tomašević, King of
Bosnia, send this embassy unto thee, for that Mahomet hath
conceived this summer to fall upon our realm. Already hath
he gathered together his array of war; nor is our strength
sufficient that we should stand against him. In our grievous
necessity we have turned to the Hungarians and the Venetians
for succour; and George, the Prince of Albania, hath promised us
his help. Now, therefore, have we also turned to thee, O most
Holy Father. No mountains of gold do we ask of thee, but
this alone, that our enemies and our true friends should know
that we have thy protection. If so be that the Bosnians know
that they fight not alone, then will their courage be the keener;
whereas the Barbarian will fear to attack our land, the passes
wherein are difficult, and the fenced cities well nigh impregnable.
Eugenius, thy predecessor, promised our father the throne,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxxvi"></a>[lxxvi]</span>
and that he would establish some bishoprics in Bosnia; but our
father refused to accept this treaty, lest peradventure he should
magnify the hatred of the Turks against him; for that he himself
was newly converted, and the Manichæans were not yet
pursued the realm. But I was christened in the true faith, I
learned Latin in my childhood, and have remained steadfast in
my Christian belief. I fear not therefore what my father
feared, and therefore do I entreat thee that thou wouldest send
me a crown and the holy bishops. Let this be for a monument
that thou wilt not forsake me or my realm. If the enemy
breaks in, a crown received from thy hands will be unto my
friends as an earnest of victory, and for a terror to my foes. In
my father’s lifetime, thou didst issue thy commands that the
Crusaders, assembled in Dalmatia under the overseeing of the
Venetians, should help him, but this pleased not the Venetian
Senate. Bid them now that they come to my aid, if haply thou
shalt find more obedience, forasmuch as they have turned from
their former designs, and they shall make war against the
Turks. This moreover do I pray, that thou send thy legate
unto Hungary, that so he may set before the King my grievous
necessity, and may spur him on to join his arms with mine.</p>

<p>‘By such means the realm of Bosnia may yet be preserved;
otherwise it falls to pieces: for insatiable ambition knows no
bounds. But if so be that I am subjugated, the hereditary foe
will fall upon the Hungarians, and having subdued the Dalmatians,
Istrians, and Carinthians, will turn his arms also against
Italy. The first fury of the storm threatens me, after me the
Hungarians and Venetians and other peoples must bend before
it, nor will Italy remain secure. Such are the foe’s designs. I
have learnt them, and therefore do I communicate to thee this
intelligence that thou mayest not lay drowsiness to my charge,
nor say that these things were not foretold. My father too had
foretold to thy predecessor and to the Venetians the fall of
Constantinople. He was not believed, and Christendom lost
one city of the Cæsars, the Patriarch’s seat and the pride of
Greece. Of myself only do I now prophesy. Believest thou
me? then succour me, and I am delivered; otherwise I perish.
O thou who art the father of Christendom, give counsel and help!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxxvii"></a>[lxxvii]</span></p>

<p>The Pope in reply recognised the truth of King Stephen’s
warnings, and promised to place the arms in Dalmatia at his
disposal, to build the desired cathedrals in Bosnia, and send the
bishops. The consecrated crown he held in readiness, but
would not send it without the consent of Mathias, Stephen’s
suzerain, with whom he recommended him to make friends.
Let Stephen prevent Mahomet’s invasion by occupying the
passes; Hungary and Venice would fly to his assistance.</p>

<p>But while King Stephen Tomašević was pleading for new
bishops from the Pope, another negociation was being transacted
between his oppressed subjects and the Sultan. While the infatuated
king was boasting that he had purged his realm of the
Manichæan heretics; these very sectaries who, in spite of the
expulsion of 40,000 three years before, still formed apparently
the large majority of the population, though forced to dissemble
their opinions, seeing themselves threatened on the one hand
by a new Romish influx, on the other by invaders indeed, but
Puritans at least like themselves, turned to the Turks. By the
mouth of their spiritual chiefs the negociation with Mahomet
was successfully completed. The Bogomiles promised to transfer
their allegiance from their Romish sovereign to the Sultan,
Mahomet on the other hand engaging to insure them free
toleration for their religion, freedom from taxation, and other
privileges.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p>In 1463 Mahomet crossed the Drina and poured into
Bosnia an army, the cavalry alone of which was exaggerated
by the terror of the natives into 150,000 horsemen.
On June 14 a Turkish Pashà appeared at the head of a
large force beneath the walls of Bobovac, the ancient seat
of Bosnian Bans and Kings. The Sultan himself came up next
day, and the governor<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>—a ‘Manichee,’ we are told, ‘who had
feigned to be a Christian’—forthwith, with the consent of the
garrison, who it is to be supposed were equally disaffected
against the Catholic rulers, opened the gates to the Turk.
Thus passed into the hands of Mahomet a fortress of the
greatest strength, and supplied with provisions for a two-years’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxxviii"></a>[lxxviii]</span>
siege. The King of Bosnia, panic-stricken at the loss of his
royal city, and seeing himself betrayed by his own subjects, shut
himself up with his treasures in Jaycze, another royal city, as
strong by its position and fortifications as Bobovac; but feeling
himself still insecure, at the approach of the Pashà fled with his
treasures to Clissa on the coast of Primorie, where, after forty
days’ siege, on condition of his life being spared, he surrendered
himself to Mahomet, together with his treasures, the accumulated
hoards of five kings, amounting, it is said, to a million
of ducats.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>The crafty Sultan utilized, we are told, the King’s authority
to obtain possession of the remaining strongholds of Bosnia.
He extorted from him writs to the governors of the different
cities, ordering them to give up their keys to the Turks. All
obeyed. The Protestant population of Bosnia did not need
the royal mandate; they looked on the Turks rather as
deliverers than foes, and in the short space of eight days
seventy cities, ‘defended by nature and art,’ opened their
gates to the Sultan’s officers.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Then at last the Christians
of Bosnia discovered that they had betrayed one tyranny to make
room for a worse. The King, Stephen Tomašević, having
served his turn, was barbarously executed by his perfidious
captor. Accounts differ as to the exact manner of his death;
but it matters little whether he suffered the fate of Marsyas,
St. Sebastian, or Charles I.; and poetic justice is satisfied, if we
may believe the statement that the parricide king met his doom
on the same field of Bielaj where he murdered his father.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> The
most eminent nobles who had not escaped to Dalmatia were
transported to Asia, thirty thousand of the picked youth of
Bosnia were taken to recruit the Janissaries, and two hundred
thousand of the inhabitants were sold as slaves.</p>

<p>By a strange irony of fate the blow fell hardest on the cities,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxxix"></a>[lxxix]</span>
where the Bogomilian faction lay.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> How terrible was their
calamity the example of Jaycze, the chief city of the realm, and
Clissa, the last refuge of Bosnian royalty, abundantly display.
The burghers of Jaycze, relying on the Sultan’s pledge to
respect their municipal freedom, their ancient privileges and
their property, had gone forth to welcome him within their
gates. But no sooner was the city in his possession than the
treacherous Osmanlì, not content with arresting the chief
nobility of the realm and the king’s brother and daughter whom
he found within the walls, seized on the children of the leading
citizens for distribution among his Pashàs and Agas, and enrolment
in his new body-guard. The fate of Clissa (or Kliuć)
was still more overwhelming. The Turkish Beglerbeg divided
the townspeople into three parts. One of them he adjudicated
to his troops as booty; another portion, the youths and children,
he set apart for enrolment in the Janissary guard; and the
remainder, but not, we may be assured, either the young or the
beautiful, he left to pay tribute for their desolated homes.</p>

<p>That it was nothing but the sheerest intolerance that drove
the Bogomiles to welcome Turkish rule in Bosnia is conclusively
shown by the different attitude adopted by their co-religionists
of Herzegovina. This can be accounted for by no ties of personal
loyalty to the reigning Duke. Stephen’s whole career
might well have inspired the most vehement repugnance among
subjects more tolerant to human weakness than is the wont
of Puritans. Stephen Cosaccia was by all accounts a selfish
voluptuary, careless of religion, described as fickle as the wind,
and reckless as he was ambitious. He had seized his son’s wife,
a beautiful Florentine, and when his son and the outraged
Duchess saved themselves from perpetual insult by taking
shelter within the hospitable walls of Ragusa, had brought disasters
on the land by his insolent pretensions. The Ragusans,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxxx"></a>[lxxx]</span>
indignant at his demand for the extradition of the fugitives,
his claims on part of their territory, his raising the salt-tax,
did not content themselves with impeaching their rebellious
senator of high treason, but invaded Herzegovina, took his
treasure castle of Blagai and ducal city of Mostar, and hardly
needed the double intervention of Pope and Sultan to reduce
him to an humiliating peace and the payment of a war indemnity.
Stephen Cosaccia changed his creed with as much facility
as he changed his consort. In the beginning of his reign, when
Bosnian kings leaned to Bogomilism, it had suited his policy
to bid for Papal favour and raise his County into a Duchy
by playing the part of a faithful son of the Church. But when
the King of Bosnia had made his peace with Rome, when all
hopes that he may have cherished of placing the Bosnian crown
upon his own head were finally dashed, when further a Papal
legate had presided at that diet of Coinica by which his dependence
on the Bosnian kingdom was formally cemented,
Stephen Cosaccia began to think that, after all, more might be
gained by fishing in the troubled waters of Puritan disaffection.
He veered round once more and henceforth poses as the protector
of the oppressed Bogomiles of Bosnia. When the persecutions of
Stephen Tomašević drove 40,000 of these sectaries from the
kingdom, they found a refuge in the duchy; and, neither for
the first nor the last time in history, a tyrant and a libertine
became the acknowledged patron of Puritans and levellers.</p>

<p>Thus, when Mahomet turned his arms against Herzegovina,
the Bogomiles showed their gratitude to their ducal benefactor,
by rising <i>en masse</i> in his defence. They occupied the mountain
passes, and while the craven Stephen shut himself up in his
capital Mostar, and drowned his anxieties in his usual dissipation,
his brave Puritan adherents kept the Turks at bay on the
frontier. One pass, however, had remained unoccupied. The
Turks burst through it and beleagured the ducal city. The
Bogomiles, however, still fought bravely, and made such successful
sallies and flank attacks upon the enemy that the Turk
saw himself obliged to raise the siege. The rest of the country,
however, was overrun, many castles of the Count of Popovo and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxxxi"></a>[lxxxi]</span>
Trebinje<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> taken, and this great magnate of the duchy slain.
The Duke saw himself forced to raise his tribute and send his
son Stephen as a hostage to the Sultan. Two years later, in
1466, Stephen Cosaccia died, and his duchy was shared by his
two sons, Ladislav, who inherited the ducal title, and Vlatko.
But Herzegovina had only gained a respite from complete subjugation.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>
Twenty years after the overthrow of the Bosnian
kingdom, in 1483, the Beglerbeg of Bosnia fell upon the Duchy
of St. Sava, the two Christian princes were dispossessed, and
the whole country incorporated in the Sandjakate of Bosnia.
A renegade member of the ducal house, that Stephen whom the
first duke had sent as a hostage to Mahomet, rose under the
name of Ahmed Pashà to be grand vizier, and is known in
Turkish annals as Herzekoglu.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>Amidst the universal ruin, the wife of the last lawful king of
Bosnia, Stephen Thomas, is singled out by the grandeur of her
misfortunes, and I have been tempted to collect a few details
which may shed some halo of romance round the unhappy
Catharine. After the murder of her husband by his bastard
son Stephen and her brother Radivoj, Queen Catharine had
lingered near his tomb in the Church of St. John at Sutisca,
the burial-place of Bosnian kings, sheltered in the adjoining<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxxxii"></a>[lxxxii]</span>
convent which her own and her husband’s piety had reared,<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
and doubtful whether most to fear her husband’s murderer or
the terrible Sultan, who was advancing, avowedly, to avenge her.
In the sacristery of the Convent of Sutisca, the Franciscan monks
still treasure an antique picture, in which Christ appears in person
to the kneeling king Stephen Thomas; and legend says that
it was in the monastery of his rearing that this vision befell the
husband of Queen Catharine. Here, amidst all these sad and
solemn memories, the widowed queen was engaged in embroidering
some sacred vestments, when the news of the rapid advance of
Mahomet, perhaps the sudden betrayal of the royal stronghold of
Bobovac itself, only five miles distant, startled her from her pious
task. In the sacristery of Sutisca, with the picture of King
Thomas, the Franciscan monks showed long afterwards<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> ‘a stole
and a part of a chasuble embroidered in gold threads by a
needle in a wonderful way, and delectable to the sight, which is
said by immemorial tradition to have been the handiwork of
Queen Catharine, the wife of King Thomas, who sleeps at Rome,
and which she left unfinished when she fled.’</p>

<p>She, a woman of delicate health, the widowed Queen of
Bosnia, the daughter of the Duke of St. Sava, on her mother’s
side<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> tracing her lineage from the imperial race of the
Comneni, fled away on foot through the passes of the Dinaric
Alps, down the valley of the Narenta, across the inhospitable
limestone desert that stretches, now as then, between her father’s
stronghold of Mostar and the sea, to Stagno, the old seaport of
Bosnia. There she found a small boat, which carried her across<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxxxiii"></a>[lxxxiii]</span>
the gulf to the hospitable haven of Ragusa. At Ragusa she
seems to have resided several years; but in 1475<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> she set forth
on her pilgrimage once more, and passed the closing years
of her life in the shelter of a Roman convent, distinguished by
her charitable works, her meekness, and the patience with
which she bore her misfortunes,<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> but haunted even there by the
craven conduct of her son Sigismund, who had renegaded to
the creed of Mahomet. In 1477 Queen Catharine died, and
was buried in the Church of the Virgin of Ara Cœli, in which
by her orders a monument was reared to her memory.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> There,
beside the feudal escutcheons of her husband’s kingdom and
her father’s principality, on a foreign soil, and in a Roman
sanctuary, reposes, as is fitting, the effigy of the exiled Queen
of Bosnia, the last monument of the feudal kingdom, and of a
dynasty essentially alien to the people over whom it ruled.</p>

<p>After her death two of her family appeared before Pope
Sextus IV., and presented to him her will, in which she bequeathed
her kingdom of Bosnia to the Holy Roman Church;
adding, however, the condition that if her son should return
from the Turks, ‘and the vomit of Mahomet,’ he should be
restored to his father’s throne. As a token, her representatives
handed over the Sword of the Realm, and the Royal Spurs,
‘which the Pontiff benignantly received, and ordered them to
be placed, with the will, in the Apostolic archives.’<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile Mathias Corvinus was taking more effectual
measures to recover at least a part of Bosnia for Christendom
and Hungary. Within three months after the execution of
Stephen Tomašević he had taken the field, and in a short
time recovered twenty-seven cities with almost the same
rapidity as that of Mahomet’s conquest. The whole of lower<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxxxiv"></a>[lxxxiv]</span>
Bosnia, including what is now Turkish Croatia, the valley of
the Verbas, the Bosnian Possávina, the old Bosnian Banats of
Ussora and Podrinia, were for a while recovered.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> In Jaycze the
spirit of the citizens had not been utterly crushed out even by
the rigour of Mahomet and the Janissary tribute. Wifeless and
childless for the most part, her burghers had not lost the hopes
of vengeance and recovered liberty: they called on the Magyars
to deliver them, and after a seventy days’ siege the Turkish
garrison yielded to the combined efforts of the besieging army
and the citizens within. The great stronghold of the realm now
received a Hungarian governor, and was forthwith made the
capital of the new Banat of Jaycze, or as Mathias called it,
to preserve the <i>jus</i> of the Hungarian Crown, the titulary kingdom
of Bosnia.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a></p>

<p>The ancient city of Jaycze, which now for many years
becomes the Ilion of Turk and Hungarian, and the bulwark of
the Christian world, derives its name, it is said, from its resemblance
in form to an egg, the Bosniac word for which is <i>Jaica</i>,<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a>
and it has thus been compared with the Neapolitan fortress
Castello del Ovo, reared by the Normans. Its high walls are still
to be seen, rising on a rocky height at the confluence of the Pliva
and Verbas; and during the days of the Bosnian kingdom it was
recognised as the capital of the realm, sharing with Bobovac
the honour of being the favourite residence of the Bosnian kings.
Nor did Jaycze owe this royal preference solely to an almost
impregnable position. As a pleasance the site is equally alluring,
being environed by some of the most romantic mountain
and forest scenery in the country, and overlooking not only
the one Bosnian lake, but a waterfall which may compare with
those of Norway. Here rose the Minorite convent of St. Catharine,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxxxv"></a>[lxxxv]</span>
enriched by many indulgences, obtained from Rome by the namesake
of the saint, the Queen whose melancholy fortunes we
have just been tracing; and here, after the fall of Constantinople,
the body of St. Luke (the greatest glory of Bosnia’s latter
days!) had found shelter till the invasion of Mahomet, when
pious hands succeeded in transporting it to Venice. There it
was deposited by the Doge Cristoforo Moro in the Church of St.
Job: to the no small scandal of the neighbouring city of Padua,
which possessed a rival trunk of the Evangelist.</p>

<p>The history of Bosnia now centres around the fortifications
of Jaycze. The city was again and again besieged by Mahomet
and Bajazet; but the citizens, amongst whom we learn were a
large number of Bogomiles,<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> showed that, when under the inspiration
of a sovereign like Mathias, they knew how to fight, and,
while the town held out, Hungarian armies inflicted disastrous
defeats on the Turks under its walls. In 1520 two generals of
Sultan Solyman II., the Bey of Semendria and the Pashà of
Turkish Bosnia, inflicted the severest blow on the Banat of
Jaycze that it had yet experienced. The great stronghold of
Zvornik, the key of the Podrinia, fell into the hands of the Turks,
owing to the carelessness of the governor, who had failed to provision
it; and two other important fortresses yielded to the panic,
one Sokol, the other the rock citadel of Tešanj,<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> the key of the
province of Ussora. Jaycze, however, at that time had for
governor a stout old soldier, Peter Keglević, who had received
wounds at Terentzin, and the successful defence of this city
under his guidance is the last and perhaps the most romantic
episode in the annals of Christian Bosnia.</p>

<p>The Turks, finding all their efforts to take the city by open
assault futile, had planned a night surprise, and, to disarm the
suspicions of the governor, had retired out of sight of the city,
as if to raise the siege. But Keglević, who perhaps obtained
his information from renegades in the Pashà’s army, was made
aware by means of his spies that the Turks were constructing a
large number of ladders. The governor accordingly doubled
the watch on the walls, lining them, where they were too low,
with foot soldiers; and was shortly made aware, by the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxxxvi"></a>[lxxxvi]</span>
secret sources of information, that the retreating Turks had
doubled round, and, making their way by stealth among the
mountains and under cover of the forest, were encamped in a
retired gorge not far from the town, intending to assault the
walls by a sudden escalade in the hours before dawn. Peter
showed himself quite equal to the occasion, and told off immediately
a picked body of a hundred men to take their stand in
the rear of the Turkish ambush, with orders to fall on the
infidels at a signal given from a gun-shot.</p>

<p>Nor were Keglević’s resources exhausted by this stratagem.
It happened to be the eve of a feast-day, when the women and
maidens of the town would in times of security go forth, as they
still do through the length and breadth of Bosnia, to dance and
sing on the forest lawns. Old Peter called the girls and merry
wives of Jaycze around him, and bade them at earliest dawn to
go forth, as if no foe were nigh, into the King’s Mead,<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> as the
meadowland about the town was known long afterwards, and
sing and play their shrillest—disarming their fears by telling
them that he would be at hand to help them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Turks, astir before sunrise for their planned
attack, were shouldering their ladders for the escalade—when
the distant sounds of the festal songs, and the Sclavonic dance-music,
the plaintive note of the Ghuzla, and the shrill piping
of the Svirala, broke the silence of the still morning air; and
peering down between the forest trunks they espied by the first
faint light of dawn the maidens of Jaycze tripping the light fantastic
toe right merrily on the green slopes opposite. This was
enough! Down fall the ladders from their backs, and forwards
scurry the warriors, forgetful of everything but the sirens across
the valley. Old Keglević saw his opportunity, and sallying
forth from the city, attacked them with a picked body of men,
while the ambushed horsemen, true to the signal, swept down
upon their rear. The Turks, in utter confusion, distracted by
the double onslaught, surprised, perhaps scarcely armed, offered
no resistance, and were cut down almost to a man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxxxvii"></a>[lxxxvii]</span></p>

<p>The Pashà, furious at this disaster, attacked Jaycze shortly
afterwards with an army of 20,000 men, a long train of siege
material, and eight cannon of large calibre;<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> but Keglević held
out, and Frangepani advancing with an army of 16,000 men,
defeated the Pashà and compelled him to raise the siege. Seven
years, however, after his splendid defence of Jaycze, the brave old
governor resigned his command, and his successor, a careless and
unwarlike man, lost the fortress almost immediately. On the surrender
of Jaycze in 1527 the remaining towns of the Banat
opened their gates to the Turks, and the whole of Bosnia to the
Save passed irrecoverably into the hands of the Sultan.</p>

<p>That the change was much regretted even by the Catholic
population of the country may be doubted. The history of the
Hungarian Banat of Jaycze is indeed less stained with religious
persecutions than that of the earlier kingdom, but much of that
feudal tyranny which had contributed in no unimportant manner
to the conquest of Mahomet was still at work to alienate
the wretched Bosnian peasants. We have the convincing testimony
of an eyewitness, and a Doctor of the Roman Catholic
University of Bologna, that the rule of the Moslem was at
this time looked upon as less oppressive than that of the petty
Christian Bans and Barons. ‘The Bosniacs,’ says Montalbano,
‘are not so badly treated by the Turks, but that those subject
to Christian rule are not worse oppressed by their own lords.
And I myself have often seen no small multitude of country
people, having burnt their own houses in their despair, flee
with their wives and children and cattle and all that they possessed,
to the country under Turkish rule, for as much as the
Turk extorteth little, save the tithe. And therefore has it happened
oftentimes that our armies in the last Hungarian wars,
when they have crossed the Ottoman border, find not the
Christian countrymen who, as they supposed, would be their
friends and helpers; or if so be they found them, they were hid in
nooks, or intent upon their flight; for no sufficient prohibition
against outrages and robberies is possible with the army. They
think themselves well off if haply their property and the
honour of their women be left them uninjured; whereas with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxxxviii"></a>[lxxxviii]</span>
the Turks, by reason of their great obedience, these securities
can be readily obtained.’<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>Several desultory attempts have since been made on the part
of the Hapsburgs to recover it: by the Markgrave Ludwig of
Baden, in 1688; by Prince Eugene, in 1697, who pushed on as
far as Bosna Serai itself, but gained nothing by his hasty dash;
and again in 1736 by the imperial troops under the Prince of Saxe-Hildburghausen,
which ended in the utter rout of the Austrian
army, amounting, it is said, to 80,000 men, and such complete
discomfiture, that Ali Pashà could boast that ‘not a hoof of them
was left behind.’<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> In 1790 Marshal Laudon took a few places
in Bosnia, but the French Revolution put a stop to these operations,
and all the towns captured in Bosnia were restored by
the peace of Sistov.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> These later efforts may show that though
the Emperor-King had resigned his claim over Bosnia by the
peace of Passarovitz in 1718, Austria, in the last century at all
events, had not resigned all hopes of recovering the old fief of
the Hungarian Crown.</p>

<p>There are very few materials<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> at hand for the history of Bosnia
after the Turkish conquest, and we have little but theories to
explain the extraordinary process of renegation which immediately
set in, and which has given us a Sclavonic race of Mahometans.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_lxxxix"></a>[lxxxix]</span>
From the earliest days of the conquest the Turks
inaugurated the policy of allowing all those natives who would
accept the religion of Islâm to retain their lands and belongings,
and we hear at once of a son of the King of Bosnia and
another of the Duke of St. Sava turning Mahometan. It
is certain that though the Catholic faction among the nobility was
still powerful, a large number of even the highest rank in Bosnia
were infected with the Bogomilian heresy; and it is probable that
many rightful heirs of ancient houses had been dispossessed for
heretical opinions by the dominant Romish caste, and were willing
to recover their honours by at least nominally abjuring their religion.
By most, perhaps, the renegation was intended to be only
temporary; they ‘bowed in the house of Rimmon’ merely to
retain their honours. Not a few of these renegade families have
preserved even to the present day many of their old Christian
and perhaps heretical observances; and it is whispered that there
are still members of the old Bosnian aristocracy only waiting
for a favourable opportunity to abjure Islâm. With the bulk
of the people the desire of lording it over their former Romish
oppressors would often outweigh every religious consideration.
It has been hinted already that the Puritans of Bosnia might
find little repugnant to them in the service of the mosques,
and we may perhaps suspect that the Manichæism which
looked on Christ as one Æon, might accept Mahomet as another.
Certain it is that a large part of the population of Bosnia went
over to Mahometanism, and those who would deny that the
majority of the converts belonged to the persecuted sect of
the Bogomiles, must account for the curious diminution since
the Turkish conquest of the heretics who immediately before it
formed, as far as we can judge, the majority, certainly the most
influential portion, of the population.</p>

<p>Strange as seems the comparative disappearance of the Bogomilian
religion since the Turkish conquest, throughout a large
part of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the more minutely we enquire
into Bosnian history the less insoluble does the problem appear.
On the whole, the disappearance of the Bosnian Protestants was
not so much due to voluntary renegation, though that played its
part, as to a cause which I have already hinted at. In the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xc"></a>[xc]</span>
days of the Bosnian kingdom the strength of these sectaries
lay in the towns; and it was on the towns that the hand of
the Turk fell heaviest. The citizens of Jaycze, and Jaycze
was then a peculiar stronghold of the Bogomiles, like those
of Kliuć, and like those of the other fenced cities throughout
the land, saw their children snatched from them, to be forcibly
converted to Islâm, and to return as Janissaries and Mahometans
to claim their heritage. Nay, more, we have the direct evidence
of an eyewitness and contemporary that the Janissaries were
largely recruited from the children of the Bogomiles.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> At the
end of the fifteenth and in the sixteenth century there were still
Bogomiles in Bosnia; but how many of them were wifeless and
childless! We have historic proofs that the Bogomiles who
existed in Jaycze in 1478 had lost their heirs; their children
were already Moslemized;—how many, we may ask, outlived that
generation? and how few could have survived the consequences
of the second captivity of Jaycze in 1527! In Herzegovina,
where at the moment of Turkish conquest the Bogomiles were
proportionally more numerous, and where their attitude, in contradistinction
to their Turcophile manifestations in Bosnia, had
been one of open defiance to the conqueror, their calamity must
have been even more overwhelming; and if the Turks bore so
hardly on their Jayczan benefactors, what mercy could have
been meted to the Bogomilian defenders of Mostar?<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>Whatever were the favouring causes of this wide-spread renegation,
its effect has been to afford us the unique phenomenon
of Mahometan feudalism and the extraordinary spectacle of
a race of Sclavonic Mahometans. This must be borne in mind
at the present moment, for nothing is more liable to confuse
the questions at issue than to look on the Mussulman inhabitants
of Bosnia and the Herzegovina as <i>Turks</i>. Conventionally,
perhaps, one is often obliged to do so, and I must plead guilty
in this respect in the course of this work. But it should always
be remembered that, with the exception of a handful of officials
and a certain proportion of the soldiery, the Mahometan inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xci"></a>[xci]</span>
of Bosnia and the Herzegovina are of the same race as their
Christian neighbours, speak the same Serbian dialect, and can
trace back their title-deeds as far. It is a favourite delusion to
suppose that the case of Bosnia finds a parallel in that of Serbia;
that here, too, an independent Christian principality could be
formed with the same ease, and that the independence of Bosnia
has but to be proclaimed for the Mussulman to take the hint
and quit the soil, as he has already quitted the soil of Serbia.</p>

<p>But, as I have said, the cases of the two provinces are altogether
different; in Serbia the Mahometans were an infinitesimal
minority of Osmanlì foreigners, encamped; in Bosnia, on the
contrary, they are native Sclaves, rooted to the soil, and forming
over a third of the population. Under whatever government
Bosnia passes, it is safe to say that the Mahometans will still
form a powerful minority, all the more important from having
possession of the towns.</p>

<p>Nor must we omit another characteristic which marks off
the Christian Bosniacs from their Serbian neighbours. As
Bosnia of old was the debateable ground between the Roman
Catholics and the Bogomiles, so, to-day, she is distracted between
the adherents of the Eastern and Western Churches, who hate
each other more cordially than the infidel. It might have been
thought that the disappearance of Bogomilism would have resigned
the country to the Catholics and Mahometans, for the
orthodox Greek element is conspicuous by its absence in the
general current of mediæval Bosnian history. But it was there
nevertheless, and in the eastern parts of the country was even
then the dominant creed. The conquest of Rascia by Tvartko
I. brought a Greek province under the Bosnian sceptre, and
though the Bosnian hold on Rascia was slight, the Greek Metropolitan
appears at the Conventus of Coinica among the great
magnates of the realm. Since the Turkish conquest the Sandjakate
of Rascia or Novipazar has been incorporated in the Vilajet
of Bosnia, and by this means alone a large Greek-Church
element has been added to the present province. Nor, if we
consider the history of Bosnia since the Turkish conquest, is it
difficult to trace the process by which even in Bosnia proper and
the Herzegovina, the Eastern Church has risen to a dominant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xcii"></a>[xcii]</span>
position. The Roman Catholics of Bosnia have at different
times during the last three centuries migrated in large numbers
into Dalmatia, Croatia, and Slavonia, where they found shelter
among their co-religionists, and it appears that the Greek population
to the South and East, who had less temptation to cross
the borders of Latin Christendom, have largely colonized the
country thus vacated.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> The Roman Catholic population who remained,
their ecclesiastical organization broken up by these
migrations, must in many cases have been absorbed in the congregation
of the intrusive Serbs, and indeed, as has been already
pointed out, the Roman Church in Illyria was to a great extent
only Roman in its higher organization.</p>

<p>The extraordinary phenomenon that presents itself in the
history of Bosnia under Turkish rule, is that till within the last
few years it has been simply the history of the feudal Kingdom,
under altered names and conditions. A Mahometan caste has
tyrannised in place of a Popish—a Turkish Vizier has feebly
represented the Suzerainty of the Osmanlì Grand Signior, just
as of old we find Hungarian Bans or Kings representing the
Overlordship of a Magyar King. The survival of the feudal
nobility has been perfect. The great Bosnian lords, now calling
themselves Begs or Capetans, resided still in the feudal castles
reared by their Christian ancestors; they kept their old
escutcheons, their Sclavonic family names, their rolls and
patents of nobility inherited from Christian Kings; they led
forth their retainers as of old under their baronial banners, and
continued to indulge in the chivalrous pastime of hawking.
The common people, on the other hand, have clung to their
old Sclavonic institutions, their sworn brotherhoods, their village
communities, their house-fathers; and have paid, and pay still,
the same feudal dues to their Mahometan lords as they did
to their Christian ancestors.</p>

<p>But though in political affairs, language, and customs, so
much of the Præ-Turkish element has survived—though there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xciii"></a>[xciii]</span>
are still to be found many secret observances of Christian rites
among Mahometans in high places,—it would be a grievous
error to suppose that the influence of Islâm is superficial in
Bosnia, or that their religious convictions are not deep-rooted.
On the contrary, the Sclavonic Mahometans of Bosnia, occupying
an isolated corner of the Sultan’s dominions, have not been
so liable to those external influences which at Stamboul itself
have considerably modified the code of true believers. The
Bosniac Mussulmans have had their religious antagonism perpetually
roused by wars with the unbelievers who compass them
round about; they, more than the Levantine Moslems, have
borne the brunt of the long struggle with Christendom.</p>

<p>Add to this what the reader will have already perceived, that
in Bosnia fanaticism is an inheritance from Christian times; that
the renegaded Bogomiles have inherited the hatred they bear to
the Christian rayah both of the Eastern and Romish Churches,
from the days when these rival sectaries persecuted them without
mercy.</p>

<p>Thus it is that Bosnia is the head-quarters of Mahometan
fanaticism, and that when, at the beginning of this century,
Sultan Mahmoud II. endeavoured to introduce his centralising
innovations and reforms into Bosnia, which also promised the
Christians a certain amount of religious liberty, he found himself
opposed here not only by the feudal caste, who rallied round
the Janissaries, but by a race of Mahometans whose religion
had assumed a national character of a more fanatical hue than
was fashionable in the capital. The wars between the Giaour
Sultan, as the Bosniac Mussulmans contemptuously called the
head of their faith, and his refractory vassals, have been described
by Ranke,<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> and need not be dwelt on here. It was not
till 1851 that Omer Pashà finally succeeded in breaking the
resistance of Mahometan feudalism in Bosnia, and re-subjugated
the country for the Sultan. Since that date the privileges of
the native nobility have been greatly curtailed, and Sclavonic
Mussulman and Sclavonic Christian alike have bowed before a
new Osmanlì bureaucracy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xciv"></a>[xciv]</span></p>

<p>That the state of the country has not improved since that
date may perhaps be gathered from the following pages.
That at the moment of Omer Pashà’s conquest some good
was done by breaking the strength of Bosnian feudalism, and
setting a limit on the exactions of the native Mahometan landholders,
is undeniable. The most turbulent of the native aristocracy
were proscribed; the most galling of their feudal privileges
were taken from them, and the Christians who had helped
the Osmanlì in this second Turkish conquest of Bosnia received
at the moment some partial compensation at the expense of
their former lords. But when the Osmanlì ceased to garrison
the country and prolonged his occupation in a bureaucratic
form, it lay in the very nature of things that he should conciliate
as far as possible those whose opposition was most formidable
to him, his co-religionists, namely, the Bosniac Mahometans.
Thus it is that since the period immediately succeeding
Omer Pashà’s conquest the state of the Christian population has
suffered a relapse, while in the Herzegovina, more especially, as
I have shown elsewhere, the tyranny of the old feudal caste has
recrudesced, and the <i>misera contribuens plebs</i> of those countries
has to bear a double burden of extortion, from the landowner
who represents the old régime and the Turkish officials
and middle-men who represent the new; so that now the Christian
rayah sees himself forced to serve two masters where he served one
before. The present Government of Bosnia consists of a small
body of foreign Osmanlì officials, speaking, in many cases, a language
which is unintelligible to the native Sclaves; ill educated,
totally unable to check the malpractices of their agents even
when they themselves have honest intentions. Though often, let
it be said to their credit, less bigoted themselves, they are altogether
unable to place a restraint on the fanaticism which is the
sad characteristic of the native Mussulman, and are well aware
that, were they to attempt to introduce those reforms which look
so well on paper, the native Mussulmans would hound them out
of the country.</p>

<p>The more we examine the character of the Osmanlì government
in Bosnia, the more unstable, artificial and mischievous
does it appear. The centralization introduced by the ‘New<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xcv"></a>[xcv]</span>
Turks’ has struck at the roots of many of the most promising
elements which Bosnia had inherited from the past, and the substitution
of the authority of Osmanlì <i>préfets</i>, in the place of
the old municipal councils of the towns, may be cited as a single
example of the mischievous tendency of these innovations. The
chief argument of those who wish to see the rule of the Osmanlìs
upheld in Bosnia is that they act as a police to keep the
peace between the warring elements of the native population.
It would not be difficult to cite isolated instances where the
Osmanlì has acted this part, and some will be found in the following
pages; but it will be found, as a rule, that the Turkish
rulers in Bosnia never put themselves out to control the Mahometan
element of Bosnia, except when under the surveillance of
European Consuls, or in their dealings with Franciscan monks,
who are virtually Austrian officials. On the whole, it would be
more true to say that the Osmanlì has prolonged his rule in
Bosnia by playing on the jealousies of castes and creeds.</p>

<p>The Osmanlì government in Bosnia is, and has been, a
government of <i>finesse</i>. It has no elements of stability about it,
and nothing has been more prominently brought out by the
present insurrection than its utter impotence. The foreign
bureaucracy in Bosnia has seen itself haughtily thrust aside by
the native Mahometans. Its manœuvres have utterly failed to
conciliate the one class whose affections they were designed to
seduce, and at the present moment there is one point on which
the Mahometans and Christians of Bosnia are both agreed,
and that is in abhorrence of the rule of the Osmanlì.
Nor should it be overlooked that two of the greatest evils
that at present afflict Bosnia are intimately bound up with the
continuance of Turkish rule. One is the use of the Osmanlì
language in official documents and in the law-courts; the other
is the direct contact into which Bosnia is brought with the corruption
of Stamboul. It is impossible that the rayah should
secure justice in the law-courts, or at the hands of the government
officials and middle-men, when his case or the contract into
which he enters with the tax-farmers must be drawn up in a
language utterly unintelligible to him, and by the hands of
those who are interested in perverting the instrument of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xcvi"></a>[xcvi]</span>
law to injustice and extortion. It is impossible that the
material resources of Bosnia, magnificent as they are, should be
developed to the good of her civilization, while the enterprise of
Europe has first to satisfy what is insatiable—the avarice of the
Divan. The Bosniacs themselves are still blessed with many of
the virtues of a primitive people, and left to themselves might
secure honesty and justice in their public officers. At present
the Bosnian <i>employés</i> must first learn their Osmanlì language,
and imbibe the secrets of Osmanlì government, at the source
and seminary of Turkish demoralization; and the alien bureaucracy
which results, acts in Bosnia as a propaganda of corruption.</p>

<p>Why not then sever a connection as malign as it is artificial?
Why not divorce Stamboul from Bosnia, and erect an independent
State under an European guarantee? The democratic
genius of the people would suggest a Republic as the best form
of government, but the divided state of the country would preclude
such a government to begin with, and a Principality after
the model of free Serbia might combine Parliamentary government
with the coherence of a monarchy.</p>

<p>When it is recognised by what an extremely precarious
tenure the Porte holds Bosnia at present, and it is remembered
that the chief aim of the native Mahometans, as of the native
Christians, is Provincial Independence, even Englishmen may
be inclined to accept the conclusion that the present connection
between Bosnia and the hated government of the Osmanlì must
be severed; the more so as the geographical configuration and
position of Bosnia—a peninsula connected only with the rest of
Turkey by a narrow neck—make it almost impossible to hold
out against a serious invasion, and put it always at the mercy
of foreign agitators.</p>

<p>Such a revolution may seem an Utopian dream; but when the
purely artificial character of the present government of Bosnia
is realized, it would be an impertinence to the confederate
statesmanship of Europe to suppose that it was unable to effect
it. For the moment, however, the ultimate form of Bosnian
government is a question of secondary importance to the paramount
necessity of re-establishing order in that unhappy land.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xcvii"></a>[xcvii]</span>
At the moment that I write this, nearly 3,000 Bosnian and Herzegovinian
villages and scattered hamlets are blackened ruins, and
over 200,000 Christian refugees are starving among the inhospitable
ravines of the Dalmatian Alps. In the interests of humanity,
as well as of European peace, in discharge of responsibilities which
no adroitness of European statesmanship can disavow, an armed
occupation of Bosnia by civilized forces has become indispensable.
When the Christian population of Bosnia have been rescued from
the grave that yawns before them, when the robber bands of
fanaticism have been disarmed, and the remnant of the refugees
enabled to return to what were once their homes; then it
will be time for the governments of civilized Europe to turn
their energies to securing the necessary reforms, and to re-establishing
the administration of the country on a sounder
basis.</p>

<p>Discordant as are the political materials in Bosnia, fanatic
as are the Christians as well as the Mahometans, I feel convinced
that there exist elements of union in that unhappy
country which might be moulded together by wise hands. The
wrongs of the Christians in Bosnia have been intolerable, and I
have shown my abhorrence of the present tyranny with sufficient
emphasis in the course of this book; but I may take this opportunity
of deprecating any sympathy with those who propose to
deal with the Mussulman population of Bosnia in a spirit of
Christian fanaticism. The whole history of Bosnia from the
beginning has been one long commentary on the evils of established
religions. Whatever terms the Great Powers may wish
to impose on Bosnia and the Turks, let England at all events
exert her influence against any setting up of an ecclesiastical
tyranny. In the interests of all the warring creeds which distract
the country, let the secular character of the future government
be beyond suspicion. Let an European guarantee secure
to the Mahometan minority of Bosnia the free exercise of their
religion and complete equality before the law, and half the battle
of conciliation will have been won. But let it once be supposed
that Greek popes under the tutelage of Russia, or Franciscan
monks under the patronage of the Apostolic Monarchy which
still sets at nought, in Tyrol, the first principles of religious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xcviii"></a>[xcviii]</span>
liberty, are to be allowed to lord it over the true believers; once
encourage the hopes of Christian bigotry and the fears of Islâm,
and the miserable struggle will prolong itself to the bitter end.</p>

<p>So far indeed from the sway of Christian denominationalism
being in any sense possible in Bosnia, it must be frankly admitted,
distasteful as the admission may be to some, that if an
autonomous or partially autonomous state be established, a preponderating
share in the government, saving European control,
must for many years remain in the hands of the Mahometan
part of the population. True that much of the present oppression
is due to them; but they are the only class in Bosnia
at present capable of holding the reins of government; they
are more upright, and certainly not more fanatically bigoted,
than the Christian Bosniacs. The weight of hereditary bondage
cannot be shaken off in a day, and the majority of the
Christian population are still too ignorant and cringing to
govern their hereditary lords. True, that the Bosniac Mahometans
are a minority; but it must be remembered that the
Christians are divided into two sects, the Greek and the Latin,
each of which regards its rival with greater animosity than the
Moslem; nor can there be any reasonable doubt that, in the
event of the establishment of a representative Assembly, or
Bosnian ‘<i>Sbor</i>’, the Mahometans would secure the alliance of
the Roman Catholic contingent, and would by this means obtain
a working majority.</p>

<p>European surveillance is in any case an absolute necessity
for securing the introduction of reforms, but there are no other
conditions more favourable to its successful working than those
above indicated. To reinforce the government of the Osmanlì
would of all solutions be the most deplorable. It would be to
give a new lease of life to all that is worst in the present state of
Bosnia. It would be a gage of future anarchy and a perpetuation
of corruption. I have far too much confidence in the
shrewdness of the Oriental mind to suppose for a moment that
the desired reforms would not be temporarily introduced under
the eyes of Europe. But the instant that supervision was removed,
the instant that the forces necessary for the enforcements
of the reforms were withdrawn, the Osmanlì government<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xcix"></a>[xcix]</span>
in Bosnia would relapse into what it is at present,—a foreign
bureaucracy, which, powerless to support the Sultan’s authority
against the Conservative opposition of native Mussulmans, is
reduced to pander to it. The old game of playing with the
antagonisms of castes and creeds would be revived, the reforms
would disappear one by one, and the smouldering elements of
Christian discontent would once more burst forth in a conflagration,
which might eventually light up the ends of Europe.</p>

<p>The great difficulty that statesmen have to contend with at
the present moment is how to obtain certain elementary securities
for the honour and property of an oppressed class
of ignorant peasants, in the teeth of a haughty and oppressive
ruling caste. To reverse the positions of serf and lord would
be impossible. To bolster up a Christian government in the
country, and after depriving the dominant caste of what it considers
its hereditary dues, and stripping it of part of its possessions,
to place it forcibly beneath the yoke of those whom it despises
as slaves and abominates as idolaters, would need more
supervision than Europe would be willing to accord; nor is it
likely that anything short of perpetual armed occupation would
succeed in enforcing such reforms, or in preventing the prolongation
of an exterminating civil war.</p>

<p>It is then of primary necessity to conciliate the Mahometan
caste of landlords and retainers, still hungering for abolished
feudal privileges, and the Mahometan bourgeoisie of the towns,
who in days of bureaucratic centralization sigh for their
municipal privileges suppressed by the Osmanlì. And such a
means of reconciling the Mahometan population of Bosnia to
the new order of things can be found,—by sacrificing the
Osmanlì. Turn out the sowers of Bosnian discord. Do not
prevent the Mahometan gentry from taking that position in the
country to which by their territorial possessions, according to
English ideas, they are entitled. Let a native magistracy succeed
the satellites of a foreign bureaucracy; revive the civic institutions
of the towns, and the native Begs and Agas, as well
as the descendants of the old municipal <i>Starescina</i>, will be only
too glad to come to terms with the Great Powers.</p>

<p>The dominant caste in this way compensated, European<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_c"></a>[c]</span>
supervision, of whatever kind, would work with at least a possibility
of success in introducing the necessary reforms; nor, the
period of probation concluded, and European control removed,
is there any need for taking the pessimist view that the government
of Bosnia would lapse into the ‘autonomy of a cock-pit.’
In the very nature of things the present difficulties have brought
the worst and most fanatical elements of Bosnia to the surface,
and in face of the ferocious deeds of Bosnian Ahmed Agas and
their feudal train of murderous Bashi Bazouks, the more sensible
and kindly side of Bosnian Mahometanism is liable to be
overlooked. I have already observed that it is wrong for
Christians to build too great expectations on the fact that many
of the Mahometan nobles of Bosnia still preserve some of their
old Christian practices, and on occasion take Franciscan monks
as their ghostly advisers. Still the fact remains, to show that
from some points of view they are not irreconcilable, and that
the gulf between Christianity and Islâm is not so wide among
the more educated classes as it is no doubt among the town-rabble.
The most influential Christian in the whole country,
Bishop Strossmayer, whose liberalism commands European
esteem, stands on a most friendly footing with many of the
leading Mahometan families in Bosnia, and when he visits his
Bosnian diocese has the satisfaction of seeing true-believers
flock to hear his sermons.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> The brutal contempt of the Mahometan
lord for the rayah is by no means universal, and even
in Herzegovina, he at times so far conforms to the kindly democratic
usage of the race as to address his Christian serf as <i>brat</i>
or brother.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> A few years ago the native aristocracy of Bosnia
showed by its secret negotiations with the Serbian government
that at a pinch it was not altogether averse to making common
cause with the Giaour. In the rural districts of Bosnia and
the Herzegovina religious animosity has never been so embittered
as in the towns. I have myself seen the tombs of the
departed Christians and the departed Moslems of a Herzegovinian
village gathered together in the same God’s acre, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ci"></a>[ci]</span>
separated only by a scarcely perceptible path. In many parts
the Mahometan peasants have suffered almost as much oppression
as their Christian neighbours, and during the present insurrection
there have been instances in which they have made common
cause with the Christian rayah.</p>

<p>If this religious antagonism can once be overcome, there
seem to be many hopeful elements left us even in Bosnia. The
temperament of the Southern Sclaves is preëminently kindly
and easy-going, and nothing but the interested wiles of the
Osmanlì, to whom Bosnian union meant his own expulsion,
could have checked the development of a spirit of toleration.
We have in Bosnia a common language and a common national
character born of the blood; and that national character, whatever
may be said to the contrary, is not prone to revolution. It is slow,
it is stubborn, it is not easily roused, and it possesses a fund of
common sense which has led a keen French observer to compare
the Serbian genius with the English.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> The Bosniacs are of
a temperament admirably fitted for parliamentary government,
and what is more, owing to their still preserving the relics of
the free institutions of the primitive Sclaves, they are familiar
with its machinery. In their family-communities, in their
village councils, the first principles of representative government
are practised every day. Orderly government once established
by the commanding influence which powerful neighbours
could exercise for pacification if they chose, the development
of the natural resources of the country would follow as a matter
of course. I have elsewhere alluded to the fact that, besides<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_cii"></a>[cii]</span>
supplying the Romans and the Ragusans in the Middle Ages
with incalculable wealth of gold and silver, the Bosnian mountains
are known to contain some of the richest veins of quicksilver
in Europe; that iron and other ores are abundant, and
that the valley of the principal river is one vast coal-bed. All
these sources of wealth and prosperity, and consequent civilization,
are at present, as I show elsewhere, inaccessible, owing
simply to the corruption of Stamboul.</p>

<p>Besides such decentralizing reforms in the provincial constitution
as connect themselves with the discontinuance of the
direct government of the Osmanlì, it may be well to cite some
of the more obvious measures necessary to secure the order
and well being of Bosnia. The present insurrection, as I have
been at some pains to point out, was in its origin mainly
agrarian, and no reform can be satisfactory which does not
secure the tiller of the soil a certain portion of it for himself.
The intolerance of all classes of the Bosnian population is the
natural offspring of the gross ignorance in which they are
steeped, and it must be confessed that the want of education is
largely due to the clerical character of the schools where they
exist and to the malign teachings of <i>odium theologicum</i>. ‘The
result of the present system,’ says a recent observer, ‘is evident
and it is fatal. The Greek children under the Higumen, the
Catholics under the Franciscan priest, the Mussulmans under
the Ulema, go to school to learn to hate each other, and in fact
this is the only lesson which as men they take care to remember.’<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
That a certain part of the revenues of the province should
be set apart for education of a purely secular kind is a crying
necessity, and the establishment of high schools at Serajevo,
Travnik, Banjaluka, Mostar, and other large towns under the
auspices of the University of Agram, but equally secular in
their character, might be suggested as a good way of remedying
the want of higher culture. For the moral, as well as the material,
elevation of the rayahs of the Greek Church it is of the
highest importance that they should be liberated from the
corrupt rule of the Fanariote hierarchy, and it might be well
to revive the national Sclavonic patriarchate, not at Ipek but at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ciii"></a>[ciii]</span>
Serajevo. To foster the development of the great resources of
the country, greater facilities for obtaining concessions of mines
should be accorded to foreign capitalists; the completion of the
Bosnian railway, and its junction with Roumelian and Serbian
lines, should be secured; and measures should be taken to
overcome the selfish financial policy of Austria, which shuts
off Bosnia and Herzegovina from the only two seaports, the
narrow enclaves of Klek and Sutorina, which still remain to
them.</p>

<p>A few vigorous strokes like these levelled by the united
strength of Europe at the ignorance, bigotry, and industrial depression
of this unhappy land, could not long be without their
result. It is a mistake to suppose that Islâm really opposes
itself to culture; and were the means of obtaining a liberal
education, free from the taint of Christian bigotry, placed
within the reach of the Mahometan Begs and burghers, there is
no reason to suppose that they would refuse their sons the
benefit of it.</p>

<p>On the whole, however, it is safe to assume that the influx
of Western civilization into Bosnia would tend to strengthen
the Christian element. The fatalistic temper of the Mahometan
dominant caste cripples their commercial energies. As
the natural resources of the country were developed, wealth
would fall more and more into the hands of the Christians,
and the balance of political power would infallibly incline in
their favour. In the course of a generation they might assume
the reins of government, which, as I have pointed out, in spite
of their numerical superiority, they are at present incapable of
holding. The way would thus be paved for a closer union
with the Christian border-provinces of kindred blood, Serbia
and Montenegro, and Bosnia might ultimately form a province
of a great South-Sclavonic confederation, extending from the
Black Sea to the Adriatic, which should act as a constitutional
bulwark against the encroaching despotism of the North.</p>

<p>To suppose that the freedom of the Sclaves of the South, of
the Bosniacs, the Serbs of Old Serbia, and Bulgarians, will, when
accomplished—and sooner or later there is no doubt that it must
be accomplished—add to the strength of Russia, because in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_civ"></a>[civ]</span>
language they are somewhat similar, is as if anyone should have
opposed the liberation and unity of Italy on the score that it
would be aggrandizing France. If the French ever had designs
on Rome they are infinitely less likely to arrive at them now than
when an Austrian Archduke governed in Lombardy, and Bomba
ruled at Naples. Granted that the Russians have designs on Constantinople,
are they more likely to gain it from a decrepit Power
which can scarcely hold its own provinces, or from a new Power
or Powers endued with all the vigour of young nationality?
To leave a country like Bosnia, isolated from the rest of Turkey,
surrounded by free States, to perpetuate agitation within its
borders, is only to weaken what remains of Turkey, and to play
into the hands of Russia. Cousinship is not always a gage of
amity; and the day, perhaps, is not far distant when the Sclavonic
races of the Balkan Peninsula will look upon Russia as their most
insidious foe.</p>

<p>As the train from Vienna descends into the valley of the
Drave a change becomes perceptible in the scattered cottages
and hamlets that fly past us. The dark wooden
chalets of the Semmering valleys, that recall Salzburg and
Tyrol and more distant Scandinavia, give place to meaner
huts, less roomy, lower, paler, more rectangular. Rich
maroon-brown beams that seem to have grown up with
the pines around, dark projecting eaves that overhang
the time-stained fronts as the shadowy fir-branches the
primeval trunks—all these give place to wattle and daub
and chilling whitewash. The eaves are now less prominent;
but if the houses are comparatively browless, there
is a pair of window eyelets under the trilateral gable, and
their physiognomy is recognised at once. These are the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
huts you have seen far away on the Sclavonic outskirts of
Hungary. You have seen them dotted about Bohemia
and the sandy plains of Prussia; you have seen them
magnified and embellished into the old palaces of Prague.
As we approach Marburg we are entering in truth on
another world—a Sclavonic tongue begins to be heard
around. Those mountain-chalets were the high water
mark of the Germanic sea.</p>

<p>For the tide has turned. Marburg, a few years ago
reckoned a German town, is now almost entirely Slovenized.
The tradesmen—nay, the well-to-do classes themselves—speak
Slovene in preference to German. A fellow-traveller
told me that since the Austro-Prussian war Slovene
instead of German had become the language of the
schools. Cut off from her German aspirations, the Austrian
Government has seen the necessity of making friends with
the Sclavonic Mammon; and, as she distrusts those members
of the race who, like the Czechs and Croats, cherish
memories of independent kingship, her statesmen have
cast about them for a Sclavonic race free from any misguiding
‘Kronen-tradition,’ and have consequently been
exalting the horn of the Slovenes, who inhabit Southern
Styria and parts of Carinthia and Carniola, at the expense
of the Germans of the towns, and partly even of the
Carniolan Wends, whose language is akin to the Slovene.
The painful impression produced by this turn of the
tables on the Germans—who look on Austria as a mere
warming-pan for themselves in Eastern Europe—is amusingly
betrayed by a recent Prussian traveller, Maurer, who
visited Marburg in 1870. ‘Another ten years,’ says he,
‘and Marburg will be as Slovenish as its immediate surroundings....
It was extremely painful to me (äusserst<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
peinlich) to see the children at Steinbrück going to or
coming from school with books in which the text and
objects were Slovene; although these little ones, even
the smallest of them, had our language at their fingers’-end
so completely that they seemed never to have spoken
any other.... We must not spare ourselves the realisation
of the bitter truth that the greater part of Styria and
Carinthia, and the whole of Carniola, Gorizia, Gradisca,
and Istria, with the avenue to the Adriatic, are lost to us.
Even supposing the whole of Southern Germany to have
been fused with Northern, and the German element in
Austria either under compulsion or of its free will to have
followed the already torn away Bohemia and Moravia’—(the
Berliner looks on the annexation of the Czech kingdom
as a mere work of time)—‘even then we should
have neither the might nor the right—though it matters
less about the right (!)—to break forcibly through Illyria
to the Adriatic. And yet our dreaminess and disregard
of the facts before us made us look on Trieste and these
former lands of the German Bund as our inheritance.’<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>—These
poor Prussians!</p>

<p>But the Slovenes are left behind—as the train hurries
along the willowed valley of the Save we find ourselves
among a population less European in its dress, and soon
arrive at Agram, the capital of Croatia, where we discover
a fair hotel in the High Street. The aspect of the
town at once strikes the stranger as other than German.
What are these long, low, rectangular houses but slightly
enlarged reproductions of the Sclavonic cottage? Here
is the same pervading pallor, the twin eyelet windows,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
circular here, and pierced in the trilateral gables like owl-holes
in an old barn. The gables themselves—more
modest than the generality of those in Teutonic towns—seem
to shrink from facing the street. Outside some
of the older houses is to be seen a wooden gallery,
festooned perhaps with flowers and creepers, on to
which the room-doors open—it strikes one as an approach
to the Turkish verandah, the Divanhané. The
headings over the shops are almost entirely Sclavonic.
Brilliant, quite Oriental, are the stores where the gay
Croatian costumes are hung out to tempt the passing
peasant. Picturesque are the windows, shut in by foliated
bars and gratings of efflorescent ironwork; strange,
too, the doors and shutters, crossed diagonally by iron<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
bars of really artistic merit, decked at the point of
intersection by a heraldic rose, and the limbs of the
Maltese cross terminating in graceful fleurs-de-lys. Not
that the object of all these is primarily ornament.
These quadruple bolts and locks, these massive hinges
and the holdfasts by them inside, which fit into sockets
as in our safes, and so prevent the door from being burst
open by hacking through the hinges from without—all
these tell a different story. They speak of times when
the streets of Agram were not so secure as at present.</p>

<p>On an eminence rises the cathedral and spacious
palace of the bishop, enclosed, like so many churches
of Sclavonic lands, in old walls with round, cone-peaked
towers—a southern Kremlin. Just below it is the market-place,
and in its centre the equestrian statue of the
national hero, the Ban Jellachitj, the poet-warrior who
in the days of the Magyar revolution led his Croats
against their national enemy, and saved the Austrian
police-state when its fortunes were at their lowest ebb.
He is dressed in the picturesque hussar uniform of his
country, with flowing mantle and high-plumed cap, riding
northwards on his pedestal, and pointing his sword forwards
towards the scenes of his triumphs over the
Magyars.</p>

<p>The town is divided into three parts, the lower town
in which is the market-place and main street, the height
on which the cathedral stands, and the upper town on
which rise many large houses inhabited by the resident
bureaucracy, where is the Diet-hall, the Ban’s house and
the Museum, and looking down from whose airy terraces
you see the lower town stretched out like a straggling
village below you, and are reminded of the view of Buda<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
from its Acropolis. The cathedral, in spite of its bulwark
of fortifications, has suffered much from the Turks,
who destroyed it, they say, three times; and inside from
its own bishops, who have defaced the gothic nave and
aisles with whitewash and monstrous Jesuitic shrines. Its
exterior is, however, still partly fretted with old stone
panel-work, which recalls the Tudor ornamentation on the
schools of Oxford. From the top of the square tower
expands a beautiful panoramas—the silvery Save and its
rich valley—the distant Bosnian mountains fading into
the blue sky; and in the other direction the dark forest-covered
heights of the Slema Vrh, which have given
Agram her Sclavonic name Zagreb—‘beyond the rocks.’
Except the cathedral, and the finely-carved façade of the
Marcus church, there are no buildings of beauty or
interest. The Ban’s residence was so completely devoid
of architectural pretensions, and so indistinguishable from
the houses round, that we should not have noticed it,
but for a large black flag thrust forth from one of its
windows in honour of old Kaiser Ferdinand the ‘good-natured.’
As is too generally the case in Hungary, the
people of Agram are far behind in æsthetic culture; the
pictures in the Academy here are few and curiously bad,
and the one good painting was not by a native, but a
Czech artist. The Agramers, however, seem to have the
good taste to appreciate this, and photographic copies are
to be seen in the shop windows; rather, perhaps, owing
to South Sclavonic patriotism, than to respect for high art.
The picture represents the funeral of a Montenegrine
Voivode or leader, whose body is being borne along a
gloomy mountain gorge from the battle-field; and the
grandeur of the lifeless hero, the dark, almost Italian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
look of the weeping clanspeople, are executed with great
fidelity to Czernagoran nature.</p>

<p>But living pictures, more artistic than the bronze
statue of the Ban, more graceful than the weeping Montenegrines,
are around us here. The market-place is a
spacious studio. The beauty of the Croatian peasant
costume is almost unique in Europe—possibly only
rivalled at Belgrade. Seen from above, when the market-place
is thronged, it looks almost like a bed of red and
white geraniums; it is these prevailing colours which
give the peasant groups a lightness and brilliancy which I
have seen nowhere else. What is remarkable is, that this
brightness should be shared in such equal proportions by
men and women alike. In Serbia—even in Turkey—the
men are not so gay. The head-dress of the Serbian
women is perhaps at times more elegant—the colours
of their dress are often more varied; but what, after all,
is a nosegay without a sufficiency of white flowers? In
the Agram market-place, not only the colours, but the
very materials, might have been chosen by an artist.
What, indeed, is the tissue of these diaphanous chemises
and undulating kerchiefs, but the mull muslin of our lay-figures?
The women are, moreover, possessed of such
a faculty for throwing themselves into picturesque attitudes
that one would think they had a drop of Gipsy blood
in their veins. In such drapery, with such instincts, such
taste in colours, what need have they of novel modes?—they
who have not yet improved away their form by
cuirasses of millinery—they who have none of the heavy
shrouds of colder climes to muffle them—whose simple
fashions every breath of wind has an art to change! The
faces, too, are rarely vulgar; these are not the coarse<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
hoydens of a North-German market-place—on their
features, in their demeanour, one would fancy that many
of them have inherited the refinements of an older civilization;
some soft Italian element, come perhaps by way
of Venice, descended perhaps from the old Roman cities
of these parts.</p>

<p>The head-dresses of these village ladies are varied, for
every hamlet has its speciality of costume. On some,
from St. Ivan, the transparent white kerchief falls about
the bust and shoulders lightly as a bridal veil; on others
it takes a rosier hue, and is known as the <i>Rubac</i>. On
others, again, as those from Zagoria—who will have it
that they are great grand-daughters of Avars—it is drawn
backwards over a long silver pin, stuck horizontally
across the hair, and depends over the back till its variegated
border and long fringe sweep the girdle. Seen
from the front this coiffure recalls that of the <i>Contadine</i> of
the Romagna. In the summer months these peasants
rarely put on their fur-fringed mantles, which resemble
those of Serb and Slavonian; sometimes they wear a
scarcely perceptible vest, but usually the sole covering of
arms and torso is simply a light homespun tunic with
loose flowing sleeves confined towards the wrist and then
expanding again. In place of a skirt they generally wear
two wide overlapping aprons, one before and one behind,
which in a gale of wind may afford occasional studies for
a Bacchante! and over the front one of these hangs a
narrower apron starred with red asterisks, crossed by
little zigzagging patterns, or by light transversal bands of
rose and lilac. But enough of such pallid hues! The
pride of their toilette is a brilliant crimson scarf, the
<i>Pojas</i>, wound round the waist, some of the folds of which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
are at times loosened and hang down over the front
apron in a graceful sling or outside pouch. Nor does a
single kirtle content them, magnificent as this is. Amongst
all the Illyrian Sclaves, south as well as north of the
Save, I have noticed this peculiarity, that they wear the
two kirtles of classic antiquity. Besides the zone round
the waist, a bright scarlet fillet—the <i>Strophion</i> of ancient
nymphs and goddesses—is wound just below the bosom,
and is fastened with a bow in front as on the Thalia or
Euterpè of the Vatican.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Croat Woman in the Agram Market.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Round their necks hangs an array of what politeness
would have me call coral necklaces. Occasionally they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
wear silver ear-rings, silver pendants on their breast, and
rings on their fingers; but of gold and silver jewelry they
possess less than their neighbours beyond the Save; the
reason of this being the general absence of specie in the
country, which prevents them from studding their hair
and tunic with glittering coins—a habit which in Serbia
alone withdraws some three-quarters of a million from
the currency. Many of them, especially the girls, divide
their hair into two long plaits, the ends of which they tie
up with brilliant ribbons; for the twin pigtails of maidenhood
are far more characteristically Sclave than German,
and may be traced among the Russians far away to the
White Sea—indeed, this may well be one of the tokens
which betray the Sclavonic origin of so many soi-disant
Germans. For boots the Croat ladies either wear a
curious kind of sandal called <i>Opanka</i>, common to the
men as well throughout the whole Illyrian triangle, and
not unlike the ancient Egyptian, made of gay leather,
red and yellow; or, must it be confessed?—they sometimes
buskin themselves in high-heeled Wellingtons! and
though their aprons—one cannot conscientiously speak
of skirts—do not reach much below the knees, these
martial casings can hardly be looked on as a concession
to prudery, for after all they generally prefer to go about
with feet and ankles in the most graceful costume of all—that
of Eden!</p>

<p>To mention such very gorgeous gentlemen after the
ladies really seems to require some apology. Imagine
some exotic insect—how else can the subject be approached?—with
forewings of dazzling gauzy white and
underwings of scarlet. The white tunic expands like
wings about the arms, and flutters from them in folds of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
gossamer; the bright scarlet vest—the <i>Laibek</i>—studded
like some butterfly with silver stars, is lightly closed over
the abdomen. These bright metallic knobs are generally
arranged crozier-wise in front, and on one side of the
vest is a small pocket just big enough to catch the corner
of a rosy handkerchief—the same with which the women
are coifed—which on highdays hangs down and floats
like a sash about the flanks. A belt of varied leather-mosaic,
called the <i>Remen</i>, quaintly patterned like the
Wallack belts, but not so broad, grasps the tunic round
the waist; and below this the tunic opens out again in
flowing petticoats, which often reach below the knees, but
hardly to the ankles, as those of some Syrmian peasants.
A similar but narrower strip of leather round the shoulder
serves to suspend a woollen wallet of the brightest scarlet
tufted over with tassels; this supplies the want of pockets,
and is the inseparable companion of the Croat, insomuch
that every little boy is provided with a miniature <i>Torba</i>,
as it is called. Below the tunic expand loose trousers of
the same homespun muslin, flowing as those of the Phrygians
of old or the Dacians of Trajan’s Column, and sometimes
terminating in a handsome fringe. The feet are
either shod with <i>Opankas</i> or with Wellingtons, as the
women’s, but are more rarely bare.</p>

<p>When the weather is chilly, or when they are particularly
desirous of showing themselves off, a superb
mantle—the <i>Surina</i>—is cast over the shoulders, of a light
yellowish ground-colour, decked with red, green, or
orange embroidery, sometimes of the most artistic devices.
Sometimes they are brown relieved with brilliant scarlet;
but the real red mantles, ground and all, occur only in the
western regiments or divisions of the Military Frontier,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
models of which are to be seen in the interesting collection
of national costumes in the Agram Museum, so that
the old German name for the Croats, <i>Rothmäntel</i>—‘Red-mantles’—is
hardly applicable to the whole race. There
is another word to which Croatian costume is said to have
given birth with still less apparent foundation. You may
search the market-places in vain for anything approaching
a ‘<i>cravat</i>,’ which is usually derived from <i>Krabaten</i>
or <i>Kravaten</i>, a broad-Dutch word for Croats. But the
high collars of these Croat mantles may well have originated
the word, though the signification from the first
seems rather to have been a bandage round the collar, or
in place of the collar, than the collar itself. For the fact
that the word really was taken from the Croats we have
the evidence of Ménage, who lived at the time of their
first introduction into France. He says: ‘On appelle
<i>cravate</i> ce linge blanc qu’on entortille à l’entour du cou,
dont les deux bouts pendent par devant; lequel linge tient
lieu de collet. Et on l’appelle de la sorte à cause que
nous avions emprunté cette sorte d’ornement des Croates,
qu’on appelle ordinairement Cravates. Et ce fut en 1636
que nous prismes cette sorte de collet des Cravates par le
commerce que nous eusmes en ce tans-là en Allemagne
au sujet de la guerre que nous avions avec l’Empereur.’
They are first mentioned in England by Skinner, who
died in 1667, who speaks of them as a fashion lately
introduced by travellers and soldiers. In Hudibras they
are made to serve as halters.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>Certainly the most European part of the present
Croatian costume is the black felt-hat, which oscillates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
between our broad-brim and what is vulgarly known as a
‘pork-pie;’ but then the brim is used as a receptacle for
vasefuls of flowers, and is often surmounted by waving
plumes, so any such work-a-day resemblances are soon
forgotten. Then there is another variety of hat made of
straw, with a conical peak, which recalls a more distant
parallel. When a Croat wears one of these, and perchance,
as he often does,<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> having doffed his belt, goes
about in his long flowing tunic and broad petticoat-like
breeks, an uncomfortable feeling comes over you
that you have seen him before; and when you have
searched the remotest crannies of Europe in vain for his
like, it suddenly flashes upon you that it is no other than
John Chinaman who stands before you! Yes; there are
the very peaks to his boots; there is the beardless face,
the long pendulous moustache, and in old days, when—as
you may see by a picture in the Museum—the Croat
wore a pigtail, as his Dalmatian brothers do still, a Celestial
meeting him might have mistaken him for his double!</p>

<p>The patterns on these various articles of attire are
striking in character; they are hieroglyphics, hard to
decipher, but long household annals are written in them.
I take it that pure ornament, as opposed to imitation of
natural forms, has gone through two stages of development,
which may be called the ‘Angular’ and the ‘Curved,’
of which the angular precedes the curved, and stands to
it in much the same relation as Roman letters stand to
current writing. During the Stone Age in Europe this
angular ornamentation seems universally to have prevailed.
It continued during the earlier Bronze Age, but
towards its close the second phase of ornamentation began<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
to develope itself in some countries, and we of the Iron
Age have seen the old angular ornamentation almost supplanted
by its offspring. At the present day, one European
people—the Lapps of the extreme north—may still be
said to remain almost in the first stage of ornament;
the hardness of their materials, the bone and wood on
which they mostly work, their little employment of metals
and pottery, their seclusion from the current of European
civilization, have conspired to keep them back. But it is
more remarkable that a people of a more central European
area, and a more prolific land, should still linger on in the
transitionary stage between the old and new styles of
decoration. Yet, as far as my observation goes, this is the
case with the Croats, and generally with the Sclavonians
of the south. They seem to be acquainted with the
beauty of the new style, but to cling with a peculiar fondness
to the angular ornamentation of their ruder forefathers.
Thus, in the women’s clothes, at least, nearly the
whole of the embroidery is of this prehistoric kind. The
high collars of the Croat mantles, which resemble those
of the Lapps in form, resemble them also in pattern.
Many of the Croat women’s girdles are almost identical
in pattern with those I have seen among the Lapps of
Lake Enare. In the Museum is to be seen a large and
curious collection of Croatian needlework, all of this angular
pattern—crosses, and lines, and zigzags. Here are
also to be seen carpets of rude character wrought by the
homely looms of Slavonia, which are curious illustrations
of the perfection of the old style—complex as the patterns
are, they are all square or angled, and might any of them
be models for a mosaic pavement; their colours are
green, red, yellow, and white, less usually purple, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
dark blue. But what is strange, is to find side by side
with these rude shapes the secondary form of decoration
in a highly developed state. The curved style of embroidery,
as it appears on some of the men’s mantles—and
it is noteworthy that it is confined almost exclusively
to the men’s attire—is often a real work of art, and the
elaborate pear-shaped forms which it frequently takes
suggest the rich tendrillings of a Cashmere shawl. So
abrupt is the leap from the ruder kind of ornament generally
used, that these <i>chefs-d’œuvre</i> of curvature seem to
be rather importations from without, than flowers of
home growth. Nor does it seem difficult to trace their
origin, for they are very often reproductions of the decorations
which appear on the costly vests and jackets of
the Turks. They are seedlings from Stamboul—less
directly, from Byzantium.</p>

<p>As in ornament so in general character, the Croatian
dress resembles that of all the Southern Sclaves, including
the Roumans of Transylvania and Wallachia, who, for
ethnological purposes, may be looked on as a Latinized
branch of the family. In parts, indeed, it has been Orientalized
by the Turks; and it is noteworthy that just as the
men’s costume in Croatia shows the Oriental influence in
ornament, so in Serbia, Dalmatia, and the lands beyond
the Save and Danube, it is the men’s costume that makes
the chief advances towards the Turkish. It is possibly a
symptom of the almost Oriental seclusion of those who
have to dread Oriental license. Often, when the husbands
dress in completely Turkish fashion, the wives
preserve almost unaltered the old national costumes; and
it is owing to this, that throughout the whole South
Sclavonic area, enough of the original dress has survived<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
to show the common sisterhood of all. And of all, the
Croat costume seems to be the best representative of the
old Serb—of the Sclavonic costume as it existed in the
days of the great Czar, Stephen Dūshan. Almost everywhere
else the men’s costume, at least, has suffered
from Turkish influences. Here, far better than in free
Serbia, is the description applied to the Serb laity in the
old laws—the ‘dressers in white,’ still applicable to the
Croat men. At Belgrade it would be a meaningless
epithet; at Agram it is still true. The Croats, too, with
their fine mantles and flowing trouser and tunic, approach
nearer to the primitive type of all—to the soldiers of
Decebalus—to the sculptures on the Column of Trajan—if
indeed we are to believe that the old Dacians were of
Sarmatian stock.</p>

<p>The same South Sclavonic unity is apparent if we examine
the pots and pans which these old-world peasants
are selling in the market-place. There is hardly a form
here which I do not remember in Wallachia, in Bulgaria,
in Serbia. But it may reasonably be asked, whether the
barbarous Serb races who settled in the Danubian basin
in the fifth and succeeding centuries could have brought
with them such an array of highly finished crockery as we
see before us here? These narrow lofty necks and luxurious
handles are surely not an inheritance from fifth-century
savages. We do not find such among our Anglo-Saxon
remains, nor even among the relics of the more
polished Franks. We must search amongst Roman sepultures
if we could find such in our own island, and indeed
this gives the clue to their origin even here. They have
come to the Sclaves of the South from a common source—the
Eastern Roman Empire. Like the coinage, like the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
rich architecture of the old Serbian Empire, they betray
Byzantine influences. The most conspicuous instance of
this is the <i>Stutza</i> or <i>Stutchka</i>, as the Croats call it. This
I have seen myself nationalized and adopted by Wallacks,
Bulgarians, Serbs, Bosniacs, and Turks, over an area
extending from the mouths of the Danube to the Adriatic,
and from the mountains of Bosnia to the Carpathians,
varying slightly at times in hue or form, but essentially
the same. In parts, even the original Roman word seems
to have been preserved. In the Bosnian mountains I
found them still called <i>Testja</i>—doubtless the Roman
<i>Testa</i>.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> This survival of the Roman vessel is shared by
the western part of the empire. The same shaped pot
turns up in Spain and Portugal. It is common to South
Italy, and to this day large quantities of these vessels are
manufactured in Apulia and exported to the coast cities
of Dalmatia. I have seen Roman pots of this type
dug up near Bucharest, at Salona in Dalmatia, and at
Siszek in Croatia, almost identical in shape with those sold
every day in the market-places of the respective modern
towns; and perhaps the best proof I can give of their
likeness is, that on showing a picture of one from Roman
Siscia to a Croatian countryman, he recognized it at once,
and exclaimed ‘Stutza! Stutza!’ a name confined here
to this peculiar kind of vessel. A kind of earthenware
drinking-cup, which occurs in still ruder forms in Wallachia,
is known here as <i>Scafa</i>, which is almost identical<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
with the Greek word for a bowl, σκάφη. To call a <i>scaphé</i>
a <i>scaphé</i>, was the Greek equivalent for calling a spade a
spade; so the Croats at any rate can hardly be accused of
not doing that. <i>Scaphé</i> is allied to another Greek word,
<i>Scyphos</i>, signifying a cup, and common to the Latins,
insomuch that one felt inclined to quote Horace’s lines to
too bibulous Croats:—</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Roman and Croatian Pottery.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The other name by which this cup is known to the
Croats and Illyrian Sclaves, <i>Scalica</i>, is equally classical,
and will recall at once the Latin <i>Calicem</i> and the Greek
κύλικα. In form it has indeed degenerated from the
goblets of Olympus! but one need not despair of tracing
its pedigree from their graceless Roman corruptions.
As to the Chalice of our own and the Romance languages,
though it is more like the classic <i>Calix</i> in shape, it is not
like these a living popular development, but, with its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
name, a mere church introduction, a fragment of antiquity
mewed up for us in ecclesiastical reliquaries.</p>

<p>The other vessels to be found in the Croatian crockery-markets,
if they do not both in shape and name so obviously
betray Roman influences, at least in nearly every
case bear witness to the common character of South
Sclavonic civilization. There is hardly a shape in the
Agram market which may not be found again at Belgrade
or Bucharest.</p>

<p>If we pursue this science of the market-place and
examine the rude jewelry which the Agram maidens are
wearing, or the musical instruments which the countrymen
have stuck into their belts or slung round their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
shoulders, we are again struck by this double evidence of
South Sclavonic solidarity and the influence of Greco-Roman
civilization. There are some ancient Croatian
brooches in the Museum at Agram on which is to be
seen the same filagree-work—the pyramids of grains, the
spiral tendrillings, which turn up again on other gold
and silver ornaments—Frankish, Norse, and Anglo-Saxon—and
proclaim the common late-Roman origin of all.
Like those of our old English barrows, these brooches
are bossed with gems set in raised sockets. But here,
unlike in England, this kind of work seems never to
have died out; it is perpetuated still in the ear-rings,
studs, and brooches of the modern Croats. The same
Byzantine style reappears among Serbs and Roumans, and
we shall find it again among the Bosnian mountains.</p>

<p>But how strangely classic are the musical instruments
of the Croats! What visions of bucolic shepherds, of
fauns and dancing satyrs; what memories of idyllic
strains do they call up! Can it be merely that we are
overlooking the same Arcadian kind of life that the
Greek poet might have surveyed when he strolled forth
beyond the walls of Syracuse? Is ‘the oaten stop and
pastoral song’ the same, simply because the Croat
shepherd of the Save-lands is in the same stage of civilization
as was the rural Greek? Or are the pipes and lutes
before us actually heirlooms from the very shepherds of
whom Theocritus piped on the thymy pastures of Hybla?—the
same with which Thyrsis and Corydon contended on
the green banks of the Mincius? It really almost seemed
so. I asked a countryman the name of his pipe, and to
my amazement his reply was <i>Fistjela</i>. The man did not
understand a word of Latin, but this seemed a very good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
attempt at <i>Fistula</i>, the pastoral pipe of the Romans, the
very instrument which Thyrsis vowed to hang on the
sacred pine. The old Pan’s pipe,<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> however, was a series
of reeds waxed on to a stem in decreasing order, while
this was a single reed, though more often a wooden pipe.
It was also known as <i>Fuškola</i>.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> Then there are the
double pipes, the Roman <i>Tibiæ</i>. A slight development
has indeed taken place. Instead of being held separate
in the mouth, their ends are joined by a mouth-piece.
The V has become a Y, that is all. They are also like
the double pipes of classic times in being, as the ancients
have it, ‘male and female,’ for the number of holes being
uneven in the two branches—four in one and three in
the other—one barrel is shriller than the other, and their
blended notes may still be called, as they were by the
Greeks, ‘married piping.’<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Their name is <i>Svirala</i>, but in
parts of Serbia <i>Diplé</i>, which is evidently Greek; and
yet if their origin can be traced back to Hellenic times,
it can be traced further back still to the double pipes of
the Theban monument, on which the Egyptian ladies of
Moses’ time are seen playing to their God Ptah.</p>

<p>Next, the Croats have a rude kind of flute possessed
of the same Romance name <i>Fluta</i>, the Wallachian
Flaute, the Italian Flauto; and lastly, the favourite instrument
of all—the <i>Tamburica</i>, a simple form of lute
with a straight neck and oval body, and four strings,
or rather wires. Its name seems connected with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
Persian drum or Tambûr; though in form, but for its
extra chord, it is almost an exact reproduction of the
three-stringed lute, the Nefer, which Thoth, their Mercury,
is said to have given to the Egyptians, which dates
back at least to the time when the Second Pyramid was
built, which was handed on by the Egyptians to the
Phœnicians and Greeks, who knew it as Nafra and Pandoura,
under which name they gave it to the Romans.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
Among the Latin peoples of the West, at least, it never
died out, and though at times changing its form it has
given the Italians their Pandora, the French their Mandore,
the Spaniards their Bandurria and Bandole,<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> and
even to us our Bandoline and—horresco referens!—the
Banjo. Sir Gardner Wilkinson’s description of the
Egyptian Nefer will almost answer to describe the Croatian
Tamburitza of to-day. It had, he tells us, ‘a long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
flat neck and hollow oval body, either wholly of wood
or covered with parchment, having the upper surface
perforated with holes to allow the sound to escape. Over
this body and the whole length of the handle were
stretched three strings of cat-gut, secured at the upper
extremity either by the same number of pegs or by
passing through a hole in the handle.’</p>

<p>It would be easy to show that the conical-shaped
baskets, the <i>Corpa</i>, which <a href="#illus01">the Croat countryman on p. 4</a>
has in his hand, is as like the Roman <i>Corbis</i> in form as it
is in name, and may claim sisterhood with the <i>Corbella</i> of
the Campanian peasant of to-day. Some even of the
windows of Agram have a Roman air, for
in several upper-storeys and outhouses,
to save glass, they are provided with a
heavy unglazed plate tracery of an angular
kind, which is an exact reproduction
of the Roman tracery, to be seen,
for example, in the Amphitheatre of
Pola in Istria.</p>

<p>It is hard to say how far these various
reproductions of antique forms may be due to the earlier
Roman or more Byzantine empire; how far they may be
waifs from the wrecks of Siscia or Sirmium; how far
filtered in from that later Constantinople which gave the
old Serbs their religion and the model of their empire.
We know that the traces of the more purely Roman
empire, which embraced the old Dacia, Pannonia, and
Illyricum, have not entirely perished, for its language lives
still among the Roumans of the Carpathian and Danubian
plains, among the Tzintzars of Mount Pindus, and
never died out in the coast cities of Dalmatia. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
Latin population, though reduced to the condition of
shepherds, may yet have prevailed to introduce some
of their arts among their Sclavonic conquerors. To
this day the Tzintzars of the Macedonian mountains
assert their technical superiority to the races round
in the practice of the art of wood-carving. Considering
the preservation of such Latin words as Testja, or
Fistjela, or Korpa, we may perhaps be justified in
assuming that many of the homely arts we see before us
are rather the direct inheritance from Trajan than from
Heraclius. Nor must the influence of the Venetians in
Croatia be forgotten; for these kept open, in mediæval and
later times, the old trade-route between the Adriatic and
the Danube, opened out long before by their prototypes
the Aquilejans.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> To them probably is due the small
wooden cask, the Croatian <i>Baril</i>, the Italian <i>Barile</i>;
but one evident trace of Venice is to be found in the
glass-works which exist at Samobor in Croatia, and in the
heart of the deep oak forests of Slavonia. The name
<i>Flašica</i>, of the glass bottles, may be formed from the
Italian <i>Fiasco</i>, <i>Flascon</i>, and the forms of the rude beakers
and the prettily rippled Croatian flasks are true Venetian—light,
roughly blown, and of Roman bottle-green. In
Dalmatia the importation of similar rude glass vessels
still continues from the small Venetian island of Murano—the
seat of the famed glass-works of old. But even these
Venetian forms are, less directly, but another inheritance
from Rome.</p>

<p>In modern times we must not forget the activity of
the new Queen of the Adriatic, ‘la bella Trieste,’ the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
Austrian successor of the great republic, nor the Italian
seaport of Hungary, Fiume, connected now with the interior
by rail as well as by the magnificent Louisa-way;
so that, with the old Venetian influences, we have plenty
to account for the presence of a considerable Italian ingredient
in the population of Agram and Croatia generally.
For anyone here unacquainted with Croatian, Italian, not
German, is the best means of communication. The
Styrian mountains seem to form a shed between the areas
of German and Italian influences, and besides, the Croats,
like the Czechs, feel a certain jealousy of the German
language which they do not experience of the Italian.
Many of the high officials here show, by their names or
features, an Italian descent. The military governor of
Croatia is a Signor Mollinary; the director of telegraphs,
whose acquaintance we were pleased to make, has an
Italian, or rather a thoroughly Roman physiognomy, and
speaks Tuscan by preference; the more civilized race
seems to climb over the shoulders of the ruder Croats.</p>

<p>However, it must be remembered that German is still
the language in use among the officers and bureaucracy
of the monarchy, and that many of them reside here in
Agram, so that the result is that nearly everybody in the
town can speak three languages—Croatian, Italian, and
German—and many of them speak French as well, which
is more learnt here than formerly, as jealousy of the Germans
becomes stronger with rising national aspirations.
Even the military speak less German than they used to
do; and here, as in Slovene Styria, the national tongue
has now supplanted German as the school speech, and
even to a certain extent as the official language. Among
the Likaner and western <i>regiments</i> of the Granitza, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
one approaches the Adriatic and Dalmatian frontier,
Italian is known even by the peasants, and in the other
parts of Croatia there is an itinerant Italian-speaking
population, chiefly from Dalmatia, who gain their living
as builders, and are esteemed better workers than the
natives. It is natural that the Croats, lying between two
more civilized nationalities, should be well practised in
foreign tongues; but it must be allowed that they have
a natural aptitude for learning them. They themselves
are quite conscious of possessing this faculty, and there is
nothing that a Croat prides himself on more than his gift
of tongues.</p>

<p>A Croatian merchant with whom we were talking
grew quite eloquent on this subject. ‘A Croat, sir,’ he
said, ‘will learn any language under the sun in three
months!—a German takes twice the time. Look at me!
Besides my native tongue I know German, I know
French, I know Serbian, I know Latin, I know Hungarian,
and I picked up Italian in a month. To know a dozen
languages is quite an ordinary accomplishment in Agram.
Why, one of the members elected here to-day for the Diet,
speaks fourteen. Just look at our philologists. Gaj was
a Croat; Vuk Karadjić was a Croat;<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> Jagić, the
greatest philologer living, was born at Agram. You
English, you have your powers; you make railroads,
you build bridges; but the faculty of learning languages
is God’s gift to <i>us</i>!’ I do not know whose gift exaggeration
may be; but, making every allowance for our friend’s
patriotism, it must be acknowledged that the Sclavonic
races have produced a large number of eminent philologers,
and it may even be questioned how far the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
German superiority to us in this respect may not be due
to their Sclavonic blood. In Agram this same faculty is
shared in a humbler degree by the peasants of the
market-place, who show quite an Italian aptitude for
understanding a foreigner, and are remarkably quick in
taking in the meaning of signs. This faculty does not
stand alone; this power of attitudinising, the very dress
of the peasants, all are symptoms of a common quality.
It is a certain subtle adaptiveness, common to the whole
Sclavonic race.</p>

<p>I had noticed in the market, sitting apart from the
light Croat country people, a man selling vegetables of a
different kind to the others, with vestments of a duller
hue, and on his head a black conical sheepskin cap,
which recalled to mind the head-gear of the Bulgars of
the Lower Danube, and sure enough a Bulgar he turned
out to be. On enquiring I found that a small Bulgarian
colony had settled near the Archbishop’s Park of Maximir,
to tracking out which I devoted my last afternoon at
Agram. Passing through the park, I pursued a path
which seemed to lie in the direction given me, and, after
meandering awhile among maize fields, found myself
presently alone in a beautiful oak forest. Through this
I wandered on, now and then emerging on breathing
glades which reminded me of the New Forest, enlivened
too with the same brilliant fritillaries, and once a
lightning glimpse of the purple emperor of butterflies himself,
swooping down from his oaken eyrie. Only one
thing appeared to be wanting, and that was a path; but
I heard in the distance a tinkling of kine, and making
my way towards the sound, espied some of the mild-eyed
cows of the country grazing among the gnarled oak<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
trunks, and under a tree beyond, a party of peasant
women and maidens, towards whom I directed my footsteps.
But hardly had I opened my lips, than, with a cry
of alarm, they scampered off, and plunged into the thick
of the forest like startled deer! The combined effect of
an Indian helmet and Norfolk coattee is in these parts
quite appalling. Only this morning as L⸺ was strolling
along a street of Agram, an old woman, mistaking him,
as it would appear, for the devil, drew herself up, and
having crossed herself and muttered sundry spells, felt
greatly comforted. But the cows, though they took my
appearance on the sylvan scene very coolly, maintained
an impassible silence, and meanwhile</p>

<p class="noindent">till happily a distant grunting fell on my ears, and groping
my way through the trees I lighted this time on two
swineherds and their charge; but the boys, though not
so timid as the womankind, could not help me, and I
must wander on till I found a woodman in a Croatian
costume of darker hue—the bright red vest supplanted
by one of funereal black, as befitting the sombreness of
the woods—with whose help I found my way out of the
forest, and finally to the Bulgarian settlement on the skirts
of Maximir, which before I had overshot.</p>

<p>The colony consisted of two very rude straw-thatched
sheds, which seemed all thatch and no wall, insomuch
that on approaching them I at first mistook them for two
long, irregular haystacks. One of the hovels was for
dwelling-house and the other as a shelter for vegetable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
stores, filled with gherkins and onions, and overgrown
by a vine-leaved pumpkin. The dwelling-house had a
kind of porch or atrium; that is to say, the thatched eaves,
supported by two poles, projected almost as far in front
of the door as the one room extended behind it. Under
this canopy were seated two Bulgars, hard at work tying
up bundles of onions, clad in their dark national costume—the
brown tight-sleeved jacket embroidered with
black, the dull red sash, the brown trouser-leggings which
are equally Turkish and Tartar, and on their head the
black sheepskin cap which had at first attracted my attention;
while on a peg behind hung one of their heavy
mantles of the same black, shaggy sheepskin.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus07.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Bulgarian Settlement.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It would be difficult to imagine a greater contrast to
the Croatian costume than was presented here. The dress
of the Croats is light and airy, as if they had strayed
from a land of perpetual sunshine. The Bulgars<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
are armoured against the elements—you would fancy
they were fresh from some hyperborean land of frost
and storms—not yet acclimatised to the sunny South.
The flowing tunics of the Croats invite the slightest
breeze; the brilliant red and white hues seem to tell
of a land where the roses bloom all the year round.
But the heavy mantles of the Bulgars, the woollen
coats, the close sleeves and leggings, are made as if
to exclude the wind and frost; the cold dark colours
shadow forth a sky to match. Yet the climate of
the modern Bulgaria, in its widest sense, does not differ
in any considerable degree from that of the Croats, except
that parts of the Bulgarian area are hotter. Both
are lands of vines and fig trees. Yet the language is
almost the same. The modern Bulgar can talk with
the Croat without an interpreter. Whence, then, this
startling divergence of attire? The reason is to be
sought far away in the dim twilight of history. Originally
the Bulgars were not a Sclavonic people. Their
kinship lies with mysterious Huns and Tartars. The
fatherland whence they wandered forth lies on the shores
of the Caspian and the mounts of Turkestan or more
northern Altai. Since their arrival in Europe they have
been lost, as it were, in a great Sclavonic sea. They have
been Sclavonized by the multitude of their subjects, just
as the Mantchu Tartars have within the last two centuries
been Celestialized by the Chinese they subdued. But it
is the northern nomads who have formed the backbone
to this large unwieldy body. It was the Ugrian dynasty
that erected in the tenth century the Bulgarian Czardom,
as civilized as any state in contemporary Europe; that
humbled Byzantine Cæsars in the dust with their own weapons,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
and planted the standard of the crowned lion at the
gates of Constantinople. It was the Ugrian dynasty that took
the lead in the first great Rouman-Sclavonic revolt against
Byzantium, that ruled for awhile from the Ægean to the
Danube, and from the shores of the Black Sea to the
Adriatic. But much as the Mantchus, though lost among
their subjects, have given the Chinese their bows and
pigtails, so the Bulgars have given their tails and dress,
at least in part, to their Sclavonic subjects; and these
shaggy sheepskin mantles, and close-fitting woollens, still
remain to tell of the chill Central-Asian plateau whence
their forefathers migrated.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp46" id="illus08" style="max-width: 15.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus08.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Bulgarian Profile.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But the Bulgars before me had other proofs of
their origin even more unmistakeable than their attire.
Their pedigree is written on their faces. These are not
Sclavonic. They are of that type,
more easily recognised than described,
Mongolian in its widest
sense, which extends from the
White Sea shores, among Lapps
and Samoyeds, Beormas and Voguls,
to the Tartars and Chinese.
Here are the curiously prominent
cheek-bones, the broad and otherwise
flat face, the small sunken
eyes, the nose flat at top and inclined
to be globular below; their eyebrows are strong and
relieved; their complexion is dark, their head shaven save
one black tuft or tail; these are true Ugrians, the ogres
of our nursery stories. The purity of their breed, as
evinced by this strangely Asiatic physiognomy, was partly
explained by the locality of their home. They had come,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
so they said, from Ternova, the holy city of the Bulgarians,
the destination of their pilgrimages, the seat of
their old metropolitans. This was the last stronghold
of the national dynasty, and to the last the original
Ugrian nucleus of the race may have clustered round it—nay,
who knows? even these poor peasants may have
been descendants of Bulgarian Czars!</p>

<p>They had come all the way up the Danube and Save
to scrape together money by their superior agricultural
industry among the lazier Croats, and having brought
with them some of their native seeds, were able to expose
for sale gherkins of peculiar forms, and finer kinds of
onions, in the Agram market. While I was there two
more of the party came up; and one of them, a fine young
fellow, dressed in European costume, I did not suspect to
be a Bulgarian till he told me in German that he belonged
to the settlement, and had come with them for a
still more laudable purpose, namely, to obtain a good
education. They had been here now three years, and,
having scraped together some earnings, proposed to return
this autumn. The savingness of the race was noticeable
in their clothing, which was the same they had
brought with them from Bulgaria; but I do not think
that any amount of patching and mending could make it
hold together much longer. The good humour which
also distinguishes their race beamed forth from their
every feature; they were evidently very pleased to see a
visitor, were delighted to let me sketch them, and one
sat quietly while I took his profile. They invited me
to visit the inside of their hut, whose thatch was partly
eked out with vine leaves and fir branches. Inside it
was very dark, the only light coming through the door,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
itself overshadowed, and from a low-burning wood fire
placed in a semicircular bay of brick which formed a
chimney above. Over the fire was suspended a copper
caldron, in which their homely supper was then brewing,
and this was hung up by a hook such as I have seen in
Wallachia, made of two pieces of wood instead of iron.
Round the room ran a low wooden platform or daïs, such
as throughout the barbarous lands of Eastern Europe
serves as seat by day and bed by night, and on which
the Turks spread their gorgeous divan. Hung round the
wall were several more of the black sheepskin mantles,
which imparted an additional gloom to this poor earth-floor
den; and from another peg was suspended the
national guitar, so that they could sing their own songs
in a strange land. This is not the same as the Croatian
Tamburitza; it is larger, and resembles the Serbian
Ghuzla, by which name it was known to the Bulgarians.
Unlike, too, the Croatian instrument, which is twanged by
the fingers, this was played by a bow. This had not
been brought from Bulgaria, but was made here by one
of the settlers, who, seeing me examining it, took it
out into the porch, and seating himself on a low three-legged
stool, played an air which was meant to be lively.
It was a dance tune, and much like those to which I have
seen the Roumans dance one of their stamping <i>Can-cans</i>;
it was the Bulgarian Igraja, Croatian Igrati, but better
known by its Serbian equivalent the Kolo, or Sclavonic
waltz. The plodding Bulgars, however, did not waltz,
but plied their work harder, with a smile of inward enjoyment
on their faces, which I imitated with difficulty, as
the tune was wofully monotonous, there being only three
strings to the instrument, all told; nor can I imagine any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
one who could tolerate such strains long—unless he wear
a kilt. When the serenade was ended I took leave
of the party, who most affectionately pressed on me a
large nosegay of zimnias and rosemary, the ornaments of
their little garden.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 6.</i>—Next day, having heard that there was to
be a large market at Karlovac,<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> about twenty-five miles
south-west of Agram, towards the Bosnian frontier of
Croatia, we hurried thither by rail, through fine oak forests
and maize-covered champaign. On arriving we found the
whole town swarming with country-folk, and the streets
lined with varied booths. Several new features appeared
in the costumes, and, above all, the greater propinquity to
the Dalmatian frontier asserted itself in brilliant fezzes,
such as are worn by the Morlachs and Uskoks of the
Adriatic coastlands. They are of brighter scarlet than
the Turkish, covered with rich embroidery or minute tassels
of brilliant silk, like the tufts on some gorgeous
caterpillar, and culminating in a peak. Some, however,
wore varieties of the Agramer’s ‘pork-pie,’ which seemed
to have been taken from patterns in the ‘Nuremberg
Chronicle,’ and are very fashionable still in Sclavonic
Istria. Some of the men wore blue vests or sleeveless
jackets in place of the red of Agram; their belts were
broader, and often displayed aching voids, in which outside
the walls they carry arms; for within the towns here
this is forbidden to all but Turks, who have managed to
associate the practice with their religion, and are allowed
to wear pistols and daggers under a conscience clause.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp52" id="illus09" style="max-width: 21.875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus09.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Sluin Woman.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But the most curious costume belonged to a people
whose jet-black hair and physiognomy suggested Zingar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
relationship. The colours of their dress were as much
darker than those of the surrounding Croats as their
tresses than the prevailing tint of hair. The women
wore over their black tunic and apron-skirt two black
aprons, one before and one behind, with a long fringe
attached; both sexes had satchels of black slung over
their shoulders, and great black or dark blue mantles.
On enquiry we found that they were called Wallacks,
or in its Croatian form, Vlach. This curious word, used
by Teutonic races<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> under different forms to characterise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
Roman strangers, is also used among the Southern Sclaves
to qualify strangers of Latin blood such as the Wallacks
of Roumania; besides, as a term of contempt for any
strangers, and especially strangers in religion. Thus the
Sclavonic Mahometans of Herzegovina apply it to Christians
generally, the Croats of the Latin Church apply
it to the members of the Greek communion, while the
Serbs of the interior, who are mostly Greek, call their
brothers of Dalmatia, who are mostly Roman Catholics,
Morlachs or Mor-vlachs—that is, sea-Welsh. In the case
of these peasants in the Karlovac market it simply meant,
not that they were Roumans or Tzintzars, but that they
belonged to the Greek Church, and the explanation of
this is found in their tradition that they migrated hither
in former times from Serbia. Now, however, they speak
the Croatian dialect and call themselves Croats. Their
homes are about Sluin, twenty-five miles south of Karlovac,
on the Bosnian extremity of the Military Frontier.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp68" id="illus10" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus10.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Croat Man.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Excepting the gypsy-like faces of these Sluin folk,
the features of the Karlovac Croats agreed with those
of the Agramers, to such an extent as emboldens me
to delineate certain main characteristics. The nose is
finely cut, but flattens out towards the forehead, between
which and it runs a deep furrow, which I recollect noticing
among many Roumans. The face is hairless save
for a moustache on the upper lip, sometimes twirled
into ferocity; and scanty whiskers under the cheek-bone,
as in Serbia, Bosnia, and Dalmatia. The hair is often
light, in the children sometimes quite auburn; the eyes
are of varying shades of grey and blue, lurking, as so frequently
among the Illyrian Sclaves, in a pan-like socket.
Hence shadow surrounds the eyes below as above, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
gives a peculiar character to South Sclavonic beauty from
the Bocche di Cattaro to the Lower Danube. So deep at
times is the surrounding shade that a poet of the race
might compare his mistress’s eyes to turquoises chaliced
in a setting of ebony! But the deepset roving eyes of
the Croat, on which he prides himself so highly, are often
at first sight repellent, suggesting suspicion and cruelty,
though redeeming lines of good-humour eddy round.
Taken as a whole, the face is wanting in the power
and massiveness of the Teutonic. Contrasted with the
Serbs, the Croats are neither so tall nor so finely proportioned;
their countenance is less open, beauty rarer.
The Croats bitterly lamented to us over the idleness of
their peasants; their neighbours, Italian and Slavonian,<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
were much better workers. They are incorrigible drunkards;
indeed we saw enough intoxication at Karlovac
Fair, and all the wine shops of the town were filled to
overflowing; wine, not <i>slivovitz</i> or plum-brandy, being
here the drink. But with all their faults the Croats are
kind and good-humoured, and certainly neither at Agram
nor at Karlovac had we any reason to complain of a
want of friendliness. The hospitality of a Karlovatzer was
quite overpowering. We were passing his house during a
slight shower, when he literally dragged us in and forced
on us his native wine—on which for politeness’ sake, I will
express no opinion—diluted with flat Seltzer-water from
Croatian springs, till we begged for mercy. The Croats
make flat Seltzer-water effervesce with a small wooden
instrument rejoicing in the name of ‘<i>Didlideilshek</i>.’</p>

<p>But to return to the market, which was on a very
large scale, embracing nearly the whole town and suburbs,
and a scene of exceeding gaiety. The booths for similar
wares were ranged together; here were mighty piles of
crockery, the <i>stutzas</i>, the <i>scalicas</i>, and all the varied
throng; there a store of glass ware from the Slavonian
forests, light, hand-made, Venetian. Then the vegetable
market embarrassed us with a choice of fine figs, peaches,
pears, water-melons with salmon-coloured slices ready cut,
rosy and beautiful apples, and delicious yellow plums like
small Orleans; further on we saw what might be mistaken
for row on row of gigantic black-beetles hung up
like vermin in a wood, but on coming nearer they turned
out to be black <i>opankas</i>, of which the peasants were laying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
in great stocks. At other shops you might procure wondrous
leather wallets, or Turkish knives, from the famed
Bosnian forges of Travnik or Serajevo; and beyond we
came to the crowning glory of all—the clothes stalls, and
the gold-embroidered Dalmatian fezzes glittering in the
sunshine. But the chief attraction, for the peasants at all
events, was the cattle-market in the field outside the town,
where might be seen herds of small Arab horses, long-haired
Merino-like sheep with spiral procerity of horn,
soft-eyed strawberry-coloured cows, innumerable pigs,
and throngs of brown long-haired goats, butting each
other and pushing at each other as if they were playing
the Rugby game of football! Over which animals, collectively
and individually, the peasant farmers were shaking
hands in the most orthodox manner, as each bargain was
struck. The goats and sheep were driven in by Bosnian
Rayahs from the distant mountains of Turkish Croatia, and
the way in which they expended the profits of their sales
in buying powder and bullets was anything but reassuring
to those about to trust themselves to their tender mercies.</p>

<p>Of Karlovac and its inhabitants proper there is little
to chronicle except that the inhabitants possess a certain
gift of inventiveness; for a report spread through the
town in no time that we had walked from Rotterdam for
a bet, and the report did all the more credit to the fertility
of the Karlovatzan imagination in that it had no particle
of foundation whatsoever. The town is divided into
the citadel and fortified part, containing the churches,
official houses, and a chilling square; and the Varoš
or suburb, which comprises the bulk of the houses.
There is nothing here of interest; the churches are bare,
with the usual bulbous spires; the houses are devoid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
of ornament, and guiltless of architectural pretensions.
They are mostly wooden; but here there are none of
the mediæval survivals of an old German town—none
of the elaborate carvings that speak of ancient civilization
and the taste of old merchant princes. Such relics
one does not find in the Sclavonic East of Europe.
Karlovac is situated well for trade. She lies on the
Kulpa, which connects her with the Savian and Danubian
commercial basins, and into which, hard by, debouches
the Korana, opening out a valley route into the mountains
of North-West Bosnia; while a little above the
town the river Dobra performs the same service in the
Dalmatian direction. She is situated on the chief pass
over the Dinaric Alps, just where the watershed between
the Adriatic and Black Sea is lowest. Karlovac
is, in fact, the meeting-place of the three high roads which
bind the interior of Hungary and Croatia with their seaports—the
Carolina-, Josephina-, and Louisa-ways; and a
new railway has opened out steam communication with
Trieste and Fiume. But despite these advantages Karlovac
has no commercial past, and her commercial present,
if we except a little timber transport and rosoglio
distilling, is confined to the petty huckstering of these
peasant gatherings. Her very origin was military. She
owes her name and foundation to the Austrian Archduke
Charles, chief lieutenant of the Emperor Rudolf in
the Croatian military frontier, who began building the
town in 1577, and finished its walls in 1582. He planted
here a colony of soldiers, for whom, ‘whether German
or Hungarian or Croat, or of any other nation,’ he gained
certain privileges and immunities from the Emperor,<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
the chief of which was the right to hold in perpetuity
any house built here. It was peopled chiefly by refugees
from Southern Croatia, then annexed by the Turks, against
whom in 1579 the still unfinished town was successfully
defended. For we are now on the borders of the Military
Frontier, the nine-hundred-mile-long line of battle prepared
by the Hapsburgh Cæsars against the Infidel.</p>

<p>It was the necessities of the Hungarian Kingdom and
the Empire, when they had to bear the brunt of still
encroaching Islâm, that some three hundred years ago
created the Military Frontier—the Granitza, as it is known
to its Slavonic denizens. The Hungarian and Imperial
statesmen of the sixteenth century had just the same
immense problem set before them as the Romans of the
earlier empire—how to defend a long line of frontier
from the perpetual incursions of barbarians—and they
solved it much in the same way as the Western Cæsars
of yore. The Roman Emperors, under parallel circumstances,
parcelled out the march-lands of that awkward
angle between the Rhine and the Danube among rude
Allemannic tribes, to be held of the Emperor on condition
of military service in their defence. So now the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
Hapsburgh Cæsars divided out the provinces bordering
on the Turks among primitive Sclavonic house-communities,
each of which held its allotment in common of the
King of Hungary on condition that it provided, in proportion
to the number of men in the family, one or more
soldiers for watch and ward against the Infidel. The
frontier was divided into territorial divisions known by
the military appellation, Regiments. Every soldier when
not on active service might change his sword for a spade,
and sank into a peasant like the rest; and the officer, or
‘<i>Ober</i>,’ left the camp to preside as judge in the law courts.
It was a peasant militia. To this day the Grenzer uniform
is but an adaptation of old Croat costume; the military
waggons are the simple village carts; the soldier transforms
himself into a boor, the boor into a soldier, at a
moment’s notice. Thus it was an organisation economical,
self-supporting—and who would not fight bravely when
his neighbouring homestead was at stake?—but military
over-pride was tempered by the peaceful instincts of husbandry.
Thus the Turk was successfully fended off, and
a long watch-service sentinelled along the whole frontier.
The watch-towers at intervals, with their wooden clappers,
may be still seen in places, as well as the now unused
beacons whose telegraphic chain could once rouse to arms
the whole population from the Adriatic to the easternmost
Carpathians in a few hours.</p>

<p>Thus the Military Frontier was originally the outwork
of Christendom, the political sea-wall of her provinces
painfully reclaimed. But the force of that flood had
long been spent—Islâm had ceased to be militant. What
had once been a military became merely a sanitary cordon,
or was turned to account to protect the absurd tariffs<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
of slow Swabian finance. Nay, it had even ceased in part
to mark the boundary line between Frank and Osmanlì.
Free Serbia had risen beyond it. It was superannuated—a
mere survival. The Military Frontier, as it existed
a few years ago, might be compared to an old Roman dyke
that once marked the limits of the chafing North Sea,
but now runs inland across the flats of Ouse—a monument
of a vanquished ocean perverted to hedgerows, given
over to the plough. And, indeed, about three years ago
it at last struck the Austro-Hungarian Government that
this unproductive rampart might be resigned to cultivation;
for human culture in the Granitza was at a very
low ebb, and the artificial clogs to social development
produced industrial depression. Accordingly the military
organisation was assimilated to that of the rest of
the Empire, and by the <i>Theilungsgesetze</i>, which facilitates
the transfer of land and the break-up of families, the old
communal system has received its death-blow.</p>

<p>The Military Frontier has ceased to exist, but the old
order of things has not yet passed away; and we were
the more anxious to catch if but a glimpse of that antique
society, so long artificially preserved from change by the
military needs of the monarchy, before it dies away from
the memory of man. For to cross the Military Frontier
is to survey a phase of society so primitive that it was
already antiquated when the forefathers of the English
sate among the heaths and fens and forests of the Elbelands.
It is to go back, not indeed into Feudal times—for
to call this frontier organisation Feudal shows an
ignorance of what Feudalism really means—but to wander
beyond the twilight of history, and take a lantern as it
were into the night of time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span></p>

<p>If the Turkish invasion can be likened to the encroachment
of an ocean, it resembled it in nothing more
than its denuding action. Throughout the whole of
Eastern Europe there set in a great levelling of baronial
peak-lands. The South-Sclavonic nobility fell at Kóssovo
or Mohatch and a hundred other fields, or skulked away
into foreign lands; and, indeed, this Feudal overgrowth
was always more or less of an exotic among Serbs and
Croats. The Turkish conquest was a fiery trial, in truth,
and yet it had the effect of purging the sterling democratic
ore of society from all this hæmatitic dross. The
semi-feudal organisation which had sprung up in these
lands—partly owing to the imperfect devices of an acephalous
society to gain the unity of action required in
war, partly to infiltrations of Western ideas viâ Hungary
or the Empire—was now levelled away by the Turks,
where it was not, as in Bosnia, assimilated. Society reverted
to that almost patriarchal form which the Sclavonic
settlers had carried with them into the Illyrian triangle
when they settled here in the days of Heraclius. <i>Vlastela</i>
and magnates now make way once more for simple house-fathers,
distinctions of rank are merged in the old equality
and fraternity that reign within the paling of the house-community.
We have seen an Imperial ukase work
much the same result among the Sclaves of Russia as
was wrought by the Turkish scimitar for their brethren
of the south.</p>

<p>Then, too, not only were the higher ranks of society
cleared away, but influences were at work to make even
the communistic village government go back a step in
archaism. Vast tracts of land were depopulated and were
parcelled out amongst new settlers, chiefly immigrant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
families from beyond the Turkish frontier. But the single
farms of those backwoodsmen could not grow into villages
all at once, and so it would happen that the mark—as
we may call the allotment—reverted to a very
primitive stage, being held in common, not so much by
a village-community, as by a single household. Thus
the Starescina, or alderman of the community, was often
literally the elective elder of the household.</p>

<p>But it was evident that if the new military organisation
was to be self-supporting, each family must contain
several adult male members—for how else could men be
spared from the tillage necessary for the support of the
household? And how else could contributions in kind
be afforded to the military chest—the <i>cassa domestica</i>—for
the keep of soldier house-brothers?</p>

<p>Therefore it was that the Government thought well
to strengthen the Sclavonic family tie, always strong, by
legal fetters which forcibly bound the household together
and artificially checked the development of individual
proprietorship. It was forbidden, as far as possible, to
alienate the property of a house-community, or to subdivide
it among its members; and so literally was this
enforced that, near Siszek for example, we heard of
families still existing containing over three hundred
members all living within the same palisaded yard, and
forming a village of themselves; nor is it by any means
rare to find villages in the Granitza consisting of a couple
of households.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 7.</i>—It was to survey this primitive régime that
we now sallied forth from Karlovac, and, crossing the
bridge over the Kulpa, found ourselves, as was manifested
still by a conspicuous sign-board, in what was once the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
Sluin Regiment of the Military Frontier—a suburban
street of Karlovac, in fact, belonging to the ex-military
district. It must, however, be remembered that side by
side with this military communism exists a civil population:
clergy, teachers, artizans, tradesmen, innkeepers,
and so forth, who enjoy exceptional liberties; so there
was not much to notice of special interest in military
Karlovac, except a spacious government school for Granitza
children. A pretty country walk brought us to the
little village of Radovac, where we lighted on a native,
an intelligent young fellow, who acted as a guide, and
interpreter of primitive institutions.</p>

<p>We looked into several of the cottages, each in its
yard, with due complement of outbuildings, garden and
orchard for common use. The households here are not
so large as in other parts of the frontier, and it is evident
that in former times the inhabitants must have found
some means of evading the law, and dividing their
property. The old order of things still exists; each
cottage has its house-father and house-mother, and everything
is held in common. But the effects of the <i>Theilungsgesetze</i>
are beginning to be felt, and the right of
any family to claim an equal division of the property
among its members is being taken advantage of. We
were shown one house where the family had just
quarrelled and split up. In this case the old house-father
and house-mother still retained their military exemption;
but the heads of the new family offshoots were liable to
service, and were not recognised as house-fathers and
house-mothers by the eye of the law; though some of
them still arrogate the time-honoured titles. In other
parts of the Frontier the overgrown households are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
availing themselves of the new permissive law to escape
from the imprisonment of the common paling. We heard
of instances of partition near Siszek, and further east, near
Brood in Slavonia. Thus the old communal life is dying
a natural death.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus11.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>A Granitza Homestead.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But let us examine one of these homesteads where the
house-fathers and house-mothers still preside—and the
description of the one we saw first will serve for all. In
order to find our way to the dwelling-house we had to
enter by a yard, enclosed by a rough wooden fence,
called the ‘<i>plot</i>.’ Within this, to the right, was the
‘<i>Kucica</i>’ or common cottage, and then followed in order
the pig-sty, the barn, the hay-loft and cart-shed, the round
conical-peaked hay-stack, and another store-house. This
homestead square reminded one of old English, Norse,<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a>
and Franconian farms; and we found the dwelling-houses
trisected into a sleeping-room, a kitchen, and a store-room,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
like the homesteads of Scandinavian backwoods.
The centre room of the three is the kitchen, in one corner
of which is a flat stone hearth, a small paved square for
cooking on, such as is universal in Illyria. In the other
corner there was a stove of a kind which also occurs
throughout all these lands; it was of baked clay, square
below, and bell-shaped above, bayed all over with
circular pigeon-holes, which in Bosnia, where still ruder
forms of this stove occur, are actually pots embedded
into the clay; though whether this practice arose from a
scientific desire to gain a greater heating surface, or
whether for the celebration of certain culinary mysteries,
or whether for ornament, or, what is more probable, by
reason of some exigencies of structure—we were never
able to determine.</p>

<p>Before the kitchen was a kind of fore-hall, as in a
Northern cottage; but, in this warm climate, open to the
air, and forming a verandah, which in the larger houses
runs along the upper storey, where the family live. We
peeped into the dormitory, which was the largest room
of the three, and saw beds ranged round the room, and a
picture of a saint suspended from the wall. The house
itself was of wood, and showed in parts the rich time-stains
of an Alpine chalet. Yet in places one might
notice the Sclavonic tendency towards whitewash and
mud plaster. The roof was double; first a shingling
of short wooden planks, and above that a substantial
thatch.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus12" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus12.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Stupa</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As to the inmates, they were engaged in the yard in
a very curious occupation. Just outside the store-house
was the most greedy-looking machine we ever set eyes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
on—all teeth and jaw, without even the decency of a
stomach. It turned out to be a stamping-mill for beating
flax, which we had already noticed on our way, going
through preliminary processes of water-retting and grassing.
At first sight the masticator looked like a monstrous
variety of the trap which children use for ‘bat and ball;’
it was all of wood, except a metal pivot or axis, on which
the upper jaw worked, and its motive power was supplied
by two Croats, a man and a woman, who took
their stand on the upper jaw, and, placing one foot on
each side of the pivot, imparted a see-sawing motion to
it, by throwing their weight simultaneously first on one
foot and then on the other, from which treading the mill
gains the Croatian name <i>Stupa</i> or tread-mill. Meanwhile
another woman took a wisp of the ready retted and dried
flax, and fed the wooden crocodile with it; and when it
had been sufficiently chewed, and the useless stem or
boom separated from the useful bark or harl, she handed
the wisp on to another woman, who combed out the
fibres in a heckle, made by the simple process of sticking
iron nails through a paw of wood fixed into the fence,
and being now both clawed and chewed, the flax was
laid in a heap, and the preparation was concluded. The
mill seems a very primitive form of the Scotch foot-brake,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
but it is at least better than the hand-mill of our forefathers,
for the principle of co-operation of labour is
invoked, and the flax therefore prepared more expeditiously.</p>

<p>One would think that the fact that the rude Croats of
the Granitza have arrived at a stage of manufacture even
so comparatively advanced as this, may be due to an
advantageous influence of the Communistic system. For
if self-interest is in the long run the best spur to industry,
yet it sometimes keeps it back, owing to a want of readiness
to combine with others. But here we find the
common interest of the house-community in the results
of labour, teaching the great economic lesson of combination,
though it certainly discourages extraordinary energy
in individuals. Thus the land is tilled in common, the
harvest gathered in in common, and, <i>ceteris paribus</i>, it is
far more probable that agricultural machinery could be
introduced in one of the large Granitza families, containing
some three hundred members, than in a village of
the same population tenanted by the small, selfish peasant-farmers
of France or Germany.</p>

<p>Besides this readiness to combine, another favourable
aspect of this Communistic society was especially striking
to one fresh from among the somewhat churlish, close-fisted
Nether-Saxons. This was a certain geniality, an
open-handed readiness of good cheer, whether of homely
apples or homelier wine. Nothing here of that jealous
attitude towards strangers so characteristic of your peasant-farmer
or petty ‘<i>Eigenthümer</i>.’ You have only to
muster up unabashed intrusiveness enough, and you may
spy out the land and all the ins and outs of a Granitza<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
dwelling-house without let or hindrance. You may rove
at your sweet will through yard and garden, take stock
of horned and feathered, seat yourself on the three-legged
stool before the culinary hearth—and pray do not let
false delicacy or closed doors deter you from unclewing
the inmost mysteries of the bed-chamber! The inmates
are only too proud to see a visitor. A comfortable sense
of co-partnership grows upon you. You find yourself
arguing some <i>post-liminal</i> right of adoption as you cross
the threshold, and end by asking yourself whether after
all there can be any gulf ’twixt <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i> when
every potsherd and goosequill is common property?</p>

<p>‘Liberty, Equality, Fraternity!’ Let this, then, be the
motto of the stranger who visits the Granitza homesteads.
Obviously new rules of social decorum must be invented
for the occasion, and our code was simple—‘Make yourself
at home.’ The idea that we could be intruding became
really too preposterous; and as for the truly insular
notion that a house could be a castle, we laughed it to
scorn! We were Communists for the nonce. The <i>Genius
loci</i> inspired us. We penetrated without the introduction
of a guide into yards and houses; or if we came to larger
farms, where the ground-floor of the house is apportioned
to cows and the dwelling-rooms of the scansorial part
of the family are above, only approachable by external
ladders, we hesitated not to effect entrance by escalade,
and the inmates were as little taken aback, and received
us with as hearty a good-day as if they had been expecting
us for weeks.</p>

<p>We could not help thinking of the contrast they
presented to the people of the same Sclavonic race,
and almost the same language, beyond the mountains<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
that fringed the north-western horizon; to the Wends,
namely, and Slovenes, of Carinthia and Carniola. For
when Goldsmith tells how</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">The rude Carinthian boor</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Against the houseless stranger shuts his door,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">he is only stating what we knew by actual experience to
be still true. It is not so soon forgotten—that chilly
night, when, for want of a single hospitable roof in a
whole village to shelter midnight travellers, we were fain
to stall ourselves in the creepiest of church porches—and
had we not sundry other reminiscences of slammed
doors and long parleyings to boot in the moonlight of
the Julians? There was always something morose in the
temperament of those Slovenes; something too much in
harmony with the prevailing black of the Upper-Carinthian
costume, with the sad weirdness of their music—what
a dirge it was that accompanied our way to that
ghostliest of shelters! The Granitza folk, on the contrary,
are light in heart as in garment; sociable, hospitable;
finding their poetic portraiture rather among those
Acadians of whom it is written that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Neither locks had they to their doors, nor bars to their windows,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But their dwellings were open as day and the hearts of their owners.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Is it that these Croats of the Marches still retain the
old Sclavonic communism, which the Wends and Slovenes
have lost?</p>

<p>It is most delightful, too, to come upon a place where
‘charity’ in its mischievous, oriental form, is kept from
the door. Here every community is of its very essence a
kind of benefit club; the common homestead is the
only asylum for the old, infirmary for the sick; in times<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
of war it was not the least important advantage of the
Military Frontier, that each house-community formed a
hospital for disabled soldier house-brothers. The communal
system prevents moreover the rise of an actual
proletariate; the flunkeyism of service is absent where all
are alike fellow-helps and fellow-masters; and no doubt
if a brother be disproportionately lazy, moral suasion of
an unmistakable kind is brought to bear on him by the
rest of the community. Here we have a kind of industrial
police organisation.</p>

<p>Endued with all this brotherly co-operation, these
social advantages and virtues, Granitza life cannot be said
to be without its brighter aspects; but alas that it should
have shadow as well as sunshine! After all we must own
that those earnest staid Slovenes, likened by the German
to his Mecklenburgers and Nether-Saxons, possess, with
all their moroseness, a more solid civilization. It was admitted
to us here—who, indeed, could not see it?—that
education was far behind-hand, and the children unkempt
and neglected; indeed, the mortality among Granitza infants
is said to be outrageous. Why, indeed, should
they be better cared for? Why in the name of Fortune
should the celibate portion of the community be mulcted
for the sake of philoprogenitive brothers? Agriculture
here is at a standstill, and the fields undunged.</p>

<p>This wretched wind-wry shanty before us, how little
does it answer to the richness of the soil! The inmates,
like those around, are poor in the midst of plenty. Dame
Nature certainly would fain be bounteous; you have
only to look at the luxuriant wild flowers that crowd
along the garden skirts to see that; they are at least quite
as good as the niggard garden patches, themselves half-wild,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
of sunflower, marigold, and zinnia,—just see! how
scornfully yon aspiring tufts of saffron meadow-sweet
climb above the paling, or peep between the rickety bars
as if to make fun of those cockered garden favourites
within! The apples and plums in the orchard to the
side are, as such, puny and poor of flavour; but the
hedgerow which fences it round is loaded with sloes very
nearly as fat as damsons; and as to the rose hips, you
might take them for filberts, scarlet-mantled. Further
beyond you catch a glimpse of the contours of Mt. Capella
masted with oak-woods, now mere pannage for swine,
but fit to timber a hundred fleets.</p>

<p>The truth is, that the incentives to labour and economy
are weakened by the sense of personal interest in
their results being subdivided. Even the social virtues
engendered by this living in common are apt to run off
into mere reckless dissipation. One may think their fruit
poor, and their wine abominable; but their maxim is
none the less, ‘Eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.’
True, a man has a legal right to lay by his share of the
profits; but who does? To do so would be to fly in the
face of public opinion, and this Granitza way of life is
favourable to the growth and influence of public opinion
of a kind. At Radovac there is a well-known yearly
market, and the peasants, as we heard from an innkeeper’s
son, drink away their whole earnings on this greatest of
money-making occasions in the four inns which compose
the moiety of this little village. In short, the house-communities
have been weighed in the balance and found
wanting. One may regret the Military Frontier from an
antiquarian point of view. Some pleasant features of
this unique society may be lost; but on the whole no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
one can quarrel with the government for passing that
permissive bill which entails its speedy self-immolation.</p>

<p>There is no need to give special descriptions of the
other villages that we saw in this part, as Radovac has
been made the peg on which to hang wider generalisations.
The village of Trn may be noticed, as there we
came upon peasants belonging to the Greek Church,
called ‘Vlachs,’ like the Sluin folk, but not like them a
peculiar people, and indeed differing in nothing from
their Roman Catholic neighbours, except that Greek
icons were hung in their rooms in place of Romish saints.
But in the villages about Karlovac the house-communities
are generally small, division has already been at
work, and I will therefore ask the reader to accompany
us <i>per saltum</i> to a more easterly part of the Granitza
which we explored a few days later, namely to the neighbourhood
of Brood in Slavonia.</p>

<p>Making our way through a country as smiling as that
which we had left behind, through common-fields of the
family communities, a-bloom with sky-blue flax, and enclosed
by old-world hedges overgrown with clustering
wild vines, or through the common meadowland—the
old English <i>ing</i>—we came to the village of Bukovje, and
were introduced to the largest family community of the
place by the kind Roman Catholic vicar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus13.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Homestead of Family Community, near Brood, Slavonia.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Some idea of the arrangement of the homestead will
be given by the accompanying diagram. We made our
way into the premises by the yard-gate and found ourselves
in a spacious farmyard fenced in by a stout palisade.
To the left was the common dwelling-house, and
around the skirts of the enclosure ranged in order the
common barn, cow-house, stables, maize-garner, goat-shed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
and pig-stye; the common stillery for making
<i>slivovitz</i> or plum-brandy, which here has succeeded sour
wine as the favourite drink of the peasantry; the common
well, with its bucket attached to a monster fishing-rod;
the common oven; and last, not least, the common goose-house.
In one corner was a small patch of maize, and
beyond the bottom of the yard was the common orchard
with its usual crop of poor plums, pears, and apples.</p>

<p>We were received in the yard by a member of the
family, voted unanimously to be the house-father, who
cordially invited us in, and having satisfied our curiosity
as to the various outbuildings, bade us enter the common
dwelling-houses, of which there were two; one a long
wooden erection with the usual verandah, used as a
summer abode, and divided into compartments for each
<i>sub</i>-family; the other, a palatial residence compared with
the Radovac hovels, brick-built and whitewashed, and
with its porch and double tiers of massive arches which
open on long corridors as in some old monasteries (for
there is something conventual too about these closes),
and entered withal by an imposing flight of steps, was not
without its dignity. The family consisted of some three
dozen individuals, mostly absent at the time on field-work,
insomuch that the garrison consisted of our house-father
and two house-sisters all told. Thus it was scarcely
more than a tenth as big as those monster families we
heard of near Siszek with their three hundred members;
but it afforded a good example of the house arrangements,
nevertheless; for in these larger family communities, such
as we saw higher up the Save, you may see several
dwelling-houses ranged in a row within the common
‘<i>plot</i>,’ so that really only a little multiplication is needed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
to gain an idea of the family community on its grandest
scale from a view of this Bukovje homestead. There is,
however, this difference, that in the larger families the
common hall and kitchen are often separate buildings.</p>

<p>The house consisted of two floors. Ascending the
porch-steps at the house-father’s bidding, we found ourselves
in a ground-floor with the fore-hall and usual tripartite
division of the ruder Granitza cottages, consisting
of a common hall or refectory, a kitchen and another
room, used in this case, I believe, as a bedroom for the
house-father. These three rooms opened on to the front
corridor; and ascending some stairs, at the end of this
airy arcade we found ourselves on the second storey, divided
exclusively into bedrooms, of which there were
thirteen, one for each sub-family. Above this again was
a loft running under the whole length of the roof, and set
apart for stores.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus14" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus14.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Plan of Common Dwelling.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the middle of the kitchen, whose besooted rafters
were supported by a massive beam as swarthy as themselves,
was the large common hearth, the wonted square
of flat stones, the logs on which were kept in place by
two quaint fire-dogs; while by their embers a large green
jar of earthenware was simmering with a savoury mess of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
chopped bean-pods, eyed from time to time lovingly by
the house-sister, she who had welcomed us on entering
with a bountiful apronful of apples. By the side walls
were three other lesser hearths, communicating with the
honeycombed stoves in the other rooms, so that one fire
fed both a hearth and a stove. On these hearths reposed
cylindrical pots with curious lids, and above the fire great
iron caldrons, capable of providing for many mouths, were
hung from the wooden arms of primitive jacks, such as I
remember having seen in Finnish cottages.</p>

<p>The common hall contained little but a long table
and two long benches, recalling, except for its honeycombed
stove, the furniture of an Oxford College hall.
It is here that the whole family take their meals; and in
the winter time, when the stoveless summer dwellings are
uninhabitable, it is here that the men take shelter from
the blast to make or mend their rude implements of husbandry,
and the women ply their homely looms. They
told us further that this was the room in which the family
met to choose their house-father or house-mother, and to
transact all common business; and, since dinner is the
natural time for all the family to be assembled together,
it is after dinner that these matters of household economy
are mooted, and the house-father, who represents the
family in dealings with the authorities, and the house-mother,
who shares with her consort<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> his patriarchal sway
over the rest of the house-community, are elected. It is
here, too, that the domestic government is thrown out if
it does not continue to give satisfaction to its constituents.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
In short, this is their little Parliament-House, and these
the earliest germs of Constitutional Government.</p>

<p>But we must leave Slavonia for the present, and transport
ourselves back in some aërial fashion to Karlovac,
from which town we are about to make our way to
Siszek by the last strip of railway we were to see for
many a long day. It may be that it was lucky that such
a means of transit was still at our disposal, since, if we
had been obliged to foot it, we must have run the
gauntlet of a band of robbers then infesting the country
near Petrinia. As a rule our Croatian friends were
never tired of assuring us that it was beyond the frontier
that these gentry flourished; and the hilly country that
rose to the south-west—the Kraina, as the promontory of
Turkish territory is known, which acts as a thorn in the
side of Austria—was pointed out as a regular asylum for
wild characters, and in fact was long the only part of
the frontier where the watch-service was still needed. At
the present moment, however, even the Croats were fain
to admit that Bosnia was free from robbers, while their
own country was insecure; and, indeed, I am afraid that
this was not such an exceptional state of things as they
would have had us believe, for when we arrived two days
later in the Slavonian lands of the lower Save we
found the whole country under martial law, owing to
the murderous infestations of brigands in the Syrmian
highlands; and though several had been hanged, the
reign of terror was such that the military government was
still continued. Indeed, just after the Austro-Prussian
war, the state of Croatia had become so deplorable by
reason of the increasing brigandage, that ‘Standrecht’ had
to be proclaimed there, and no less than forty robbers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
were hung. For some time a gibbet with its ghastly appendages
was to be seen from the train on nearing
Agram.</p>

<p>On the whole, then, it was more comfortable to indulge
in such reflections as we shot through the mighty
oak-forest in a railway-carriage bound for Siszek, than to
sneak through these mysterious shadows on foot with the
feelings of one of our great-grandfathers, when doomed
to traverse Hampstead Heath on a dark night. These
Croatian highwaymen, however, immediately under notice,
had hitherto conducted the business of the road on the
most gentlemanly principles; and though a kind of ‘commercial’
with whom we travelled seemed a bit scared,
even he could report no thrilling tales of bloodshed.
There were sixteen of these Hajduks,<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> as the Croats called
them, who had taken to outlawry to avoid the military
conscription, which has just superseded the older organisation
of the Granitza. Soldiers have been in pursuit, but
fruitlessly, since not only are the hills about covered with
unfathomable forest and hollowed—so we were told—with
caverns, but the peasants, like those of Greece and
Southern Italy, are in league with the brigands, supplying
them with food, and refusing to reveal their hiding-places.
The gendarmes, indeed, express hopes of seizing their
quarry when the leaves have fallen and the snow is on
the ground. Meantime they are at large. Nor let us
judge too harshly of their profession, for in this old world<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
East of Europe the Hajduk is often a gentleman in his
way. ’Tis Robin Hood and his merry men who still live
on, roughly redressing their wrongs in a vicarious fashion
against that society which refuses them legal requital, but
capable none the less of much tenderness to women and
children, and discriminating their friends from the class
that oppresses them. Across the Turkish frontier the
cause of national freedom, hopelessly lost centuries ago on
the battlefield, has been championed from generation to
generation by the Hajduks of the forest mountain, in
achievements not unsung by Sclavonic bards; and, likely
enough, these Croatian brothers are striving too for ancient
liberties, as they understand them.</p>

<p>It was late at night by the time we arrived at Siszek,
so we were glad enough to avail ourselves of a car
bound for the ‘White Ship’ inn on the Kulpa Quay, in
company with a Serbian lady and her child—she disdaining
not either for herself or boy the national costume
of Free Serbia. And verily she had her reward. For
what could be more appropriate than the rich silver embroidery
flowered on the purple-velvet field of her mantle—efflorescent
with the poetic yearning of the race for that
gorgeous Orient, a yearning as lively as the abhorrence
from its yoke—an echo from the Serbian lyre—a protest
against your cold foggy West—but subdued withal by a
Roman-matronly coiffure wondrously becoming to the
tranquil grace of Serbian motherhood?</p>

<p>Arrived at our inn, we found ourselves plunged at
once into Turkish society, for many Bosnian corn-merchants
from Bihac, Serajevo, and other towns, betake
themselves in the way of trade to Siszek. Among the
group of Turks who, in various awkward and frog-like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
postures, were endeavouring to accommodate themselves
to chairs, was an Effendi, a title which implies not
only a certain grade of Turkish gentility, but an education
for Bosnia most polite, namely, the ability to read
and write; and, what is by no means ordinary among
the Mussulman Sclaves of Bosnia, an acquaintance with
Osmanlì. Thus it was with a conscious sense of superiority
that our Effendi, learning our intentions in Bosnia,
expressed a desire to see the pass which the Vali Pashà
had been good enough to supply us with. He seemed
extremely surprised to see that it was in the Vali’s own
handwriting; but having convinced himself of the fact,
he first read it aloud with pleasing gusto in the original
Turkish, and then translated it into Bosniac for the
benefit of the Sclavonic Mahometans and our Croatian
landlord, with many assurances that with such an ‘open
sesamé’ we should have no difficulty in unlocking the
innermost fastnesses of Bosnia or even the Herzegovina,
where the revolt had now broken out.</p>

<p>There was also a venerable Turk of singularly dignified
mien, with patriarchal beard and capacious turban,
who sat in mild contemplation, lulled by the measured
purring of his narghilé, lost to all mundane concerns,
sagely superior to the curiosity which our pass and travelling
gear were exciting in less exalted bosoms, and
benignantly indifferent even to the indignity of a chair.
Our host told us that he was a Hadji, or pilgrim, then on
his way from Buda, where he resided as a merchant, to
Mecca.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 8.</i>—Next morning we sallied forth to explore
what might remain of ancient Siscia. For we are now on
classic ground. Siszek is but the corruption of a name<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
great in all ages of imperial Rome, and greatest in the
twilight of her empire. There was a time when Siscia
was one of the sovereign cities of the world. She was
a bulwark against barbarians, an emporium of commerce,
a seat of emperors, a mother of martyrs, a gathering point
for Roman-Christian Saga. And her older name, Segestica,
takes us back to times prior to the Roman conquest
itself, when she formed part of that Celtic empire of race,
dim, commercial, reaching from Gades to the swamps of
Nether Rhine; from glacial Ierné to the mouths of Ister.
Segestica! we have no record of her dealings with the
Adriatic votaries of Belenus,<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> nor what Taurisk gold passed
current in her streets; and yet her peasant citizens of to-day
plough up an abundance of bronze-age sickles as if
to bear witness of her old Celtic industry and her very
name calls up golden harvests of antiquity ready garnered
into her warehouses from rich Pannonian plains, with a
side suggestion perchance of her</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Seges clypeata virorum,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">that twice withstood the arms of Rome successfully, till
Augustus reduced her, and made of her a stationary
camp for his cohorts.</p>

<p>She is now Siscia, a convenient <i>point d’appui</i> for
Dacian campaigns; the winter quarters for Tiberius in his
Pannonian war; by Septimius Severus made the seat of
military government for his world, and so benefited by
him that she took the name of Septimia Siscia. Probably
under Vespasian,<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> a Roman colony had been already
planted here, and Siscia became a Republic with municipal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
liberties modelled on those of the parent city. An
inscription still recalls her Duumviri, who, in Rome’s
provincial mirrors, reflected the two Consuls. Later on,
Siscia becomes the chief city of Upper Pannonia; then,
when Savia was made a province, the residence of its
Corrector. She was the seat of an imperial treasury, and
it was here that the ‘most splendid Provost of the Ironworkers’
received the revenue from Noric mines. Here,
too, was established the Premier Mint of the Roman
Empire; and Siscia shares with Rome herself the distinguished
honour of first imprinting her name in full
on the imperial currency. What numismatist does not
know and covet that coin of Gallienus? or that choice
piece of the Emperor who sprang from her Savian rival
Sirmium (though from this legend one would think
he was really of Siscia), with the proud inscription, ‘Siscia
Probi Aug.’—the Siscia of Probus? On it is to be seen
the personification of the queenly city, holding in her
hands the laurel-wreath of empire, while at her feet her two
subject rivers pour bounteously from their tributary urns.</p>

<p>But this medallic fertility, which has scattered the
coins of Siscia over the fields of remotest Britain, was
only the natural result of her commercial eminence. She
was the staple of trade between the Adriatic and the
Danubian basin—old Celtic trade-routes probably surviving
the Roman conquest. ‘Siscia,’ says Strabo, ‘lies
at the confluence of many rivers, all navigable. It is at
the foot of the Alps, whose streams bear to it much merchandise,
Italian and other. These are borne in waggons
from Aquileja over Ocra, the lowest part of the Alps, to
Nauportus, and thence by the Corcoras into the Save,’—and
so to Siscia. The wine and oil wafted from more
southern climes into the havens of that Venice of Roman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
Adria; the carpets and woollens of Patavium that
rumbled into her markets by the Æmilian Way; the furs
and amber that the barbarian dealers bore her from the
cold shores of the Baltic, and Fennic forests; perhaps, too,
her own costly wine stored up in wooden barrels—all
these, we may believe, and more, were piled on the
Aquilejan waggons and dragged up the Alpine steep by
oxen, thence to be floated down the Save to the Siscian
wharves. In the markets of Siscia the Aquilejese merchants
might lay in their stock of grain, or hides, or keen
Noric steel, and take their pick of cattle, or tattooed
Illyrian slaves. From the whole of Eastern Europe wares
might flow together here; for not only was Siscia at the
confluence of the Save and Kulpa, but she was at the
junction of great roads, which, with their branches, connected
her with the Upper and Lower Danube, with the
interior of Dalmatia as well as her coast-land, and with
Nauportus and Italy, overland.</p>

<p>Not long ago an interesting relic was found in Croatia,
which perhaps speaks more clearly than anything else of
the majesty to which Siscia ultimately attained. It is a
cedarn chest, once gilt, on which are carved, by a late
Roman hand, what are meant to be personifications of the
five premier cities of the Roman world. In the centre—</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Rome, with her usual attributes of helmet, spear, and
shield, is enthroned as a goddess. To her right two more
female figures, distinguished by scrolls as Constantinople<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
and Carthage, hold wreaths in their hands and look
towards Rome. On her left, two other goddess-cities do
the same; one is Nicomedia, the other Siscia. The
carving is probably fourth-century work; and certainly,
exalted as is the position claimed on it for Siscia, it is
almost borne out by her coinage of the same period, for
the activity of her mint shows that her commercial splendour
was still at its zenith down to at least the days
of Theodosius the Great; while the coins of her rival
Sirmium wax fewer and fewer, and finally cease altogether.
For Sirmium may have been of greater value
as a military station,<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> and perhaps a pleasanter residence
for emperors and bishops, and therefore of greater administrative
importance, and of more frequent mention by
historians; but that she was a greater city than Siscia—as
is so confidently assumed by some writers—may reasonably
be doubted, and the very bustle of Siscian markets
may have deterred princes from fixing here their court.</p>

<p>The comparatively high state of Siscian civilisation is
also attested by her coins—those superb medallions of
gold and silver—those gems of the fourth-century monetary
art that stand out among the poorer products of
mints Gallic and Britannic. But what distinguishes the
Siscian coins as much as their workmanship is their
peculiarly Christian character. It is here that the first
purely Christian type—that, namely, which alludes to
the vision of Constantine, first makes its appearance—indeed,
during the fourth century the sacred monogram
may almost be regarded as a Siscian mint-mark. And we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
know from other sources that Christianity had early
struck root here; for not only is its existence attested
by two sepulchral inscriptions of Roman date discovered
here, but its vitality is celebrated by a relation of Jerome
and a hymn of Prudentius,<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> recording the martyrdom of
a Siscian citizen and bishop, Quirinus:—</p>

<p class="noindent">It was during the persecution of Diocletian and ‘Duke’
Galerius, as Prudentius styles him, that Quirinus, bishop
of Siscia, refused to burn incense on the heathen altar
at the bidding of the Governor Maximus, on the plea—countenanced,
indeed, by inspired writers, but which a
little philology would have spared him—‘that all the
gods of the Gentiles were demons.’ ‘If you will allow,’
said Maximus, ‘that the gods which the Roman Empire
serves are powerful, you shall be made priest to the
great god Jove, otherwise you shall be sent to Amantius,
præfect of First Pannonia, and receive from him condign
sentence of death.’ The stout-hearted bishop, refusing
these terms, is sent to Sabaria, where he is tried and
condemned in the theatre, and with a millstone round
his neck is thrown from the bridge above into the river;
when, lo! despite the weight of rock, the water miraculously
supports him:—</p>

<p class="noindent">till, having exhorted the faithful and confounded the
heathen from his watery pulpit, his spirit ascends and the
laws of gravity resume their sway.</p>

<p>In the dark period which followed the barbarian
invasions, something of her old secular glory was still
reflected in the Siscian Church. After the destruction
of Sirmium by the Huns in 441, Siscia transferred her
ecclesiastical allegiance to Salona. Her decline was more
lingering than that of her rival, for her prosperity had
rested on a more solid foundation. Her bishops survive
the settlement of the Sclaves hereabouts in the time of
Heraclius. In the ninth century we find her the residence
of a Sclavonic prince; but she suffered from the Frankish
invasion, and in the tenth century was finally razed by
the Magyars. Now at last the Siscian episcopate dies out,
to live again with renewed splendour at Agram.</p>

<p>The old walls of Siscia are traced in a pear-shaped
form on the left bank of the Kulpa between it and the
Save. But just outside our inn, on the right bank of the
river, we came upon several fragments of old Siscia, some
sculptures and inscriptions walled into the foundations of
modern houses. In the tympanum of a door are three
sculptures, one of which may be meant for Apollo, though
only the head and half the body survive, and another for
Andromeda; these two of base art; but the third, a griffin,
of somewhat better work. Here and there were stumps
of columns, and Roman tiles might be seen still in use.
On the hill above, still on the right side of the Kulpa,
the wooden cottages almost always rested on foundations
composed of Roman blocks, amongst which many inscriptions
may lie hid, though we discovered none that had not
already been conscientiously described by Agram antiquaries.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
It was strange, however, to observe how the irony of
fate had converted to modern utility the pomp of ancient
funerals and the furniture of the ‘immortal gods’! A
Roman altar, with its face and what inscription there
may have been (for we could not get it raised), buried in
the dust, had been turned into a seat for Croat wives; a
Roman sarcophagus in one of the cottage yards had been
converted into a horse-trough, and another had been
emended so as to form a serviceable sofa.</p>

<p>On the summit of the heights which here overlook
the river is the site of a Roman cemetery, and the owner
of the vineyards where most of the remains had been
discovered kindly showed us over his domain. Many
fine sarcophagi—the best of which are to be seen in the
Agram museum—had been dug up here, containing the
usual amount of coins, lamps, urns, and ashes, amongst
which the skull-bones were most distinguishable. In one
place we were shown a Roman conduit, square in shape,
and the outside glazed as if by a conflagration. Near
the old cemetery might be seen Roman walls, and some
cottage foundations consisting entirely of Roman tiles.</p>

<p>The most interesting Roman fragments were, however,
on the left side of the Kulpa, where the town walls are
traceable, in a garden by the railway-station. There
we found an altar with an inscription<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> showing that it
was dedicated to Ceres, with a vase and patera engraved
on one side, and on the other a jar full of spikes of
corn. Close by lay mutilations of what once had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
Corinthian capitals, with rich acanthus-leaves decayed by
many winters; fragments of a marble frieze with wavy
vine-sprays loaded with bunches of grapes fit for the Land
of Promise; besides, other marble bits on which were
sculptured beakers and telescopic flowers unknown to
botanists, and spiral knot-work which seemed almost
Byzantine. It was pleasant to believe that they all
formed part of a temple of the corn-goddess, though I
doubt whether all the fragments could be attributed
either to the same building or the same age; and perhaps
Father Liber or Isis, whose altars have also been discovered
here, may lay as good claim to some of these vinous and
floral devices as Mother Ceres.</p>

<p>But whatever view be taken, these remains are interesting
as an illustration of the old position of Siscia as
centre of a corn and vine-growing district; nor indeed are
they inappropriate even to her present state. The present
town of Siszek derives what trade she possesses mainly
from the transport of cereals. Hither the maize and
wheat from the rich alluvial plains of the Banat and the
Possávina, as well as from the interior of Bosnia, are conveyed
by the Save and its tributaries; for Siszek is the
point where the land-carriage to the north and west commences,
and she really stands to Trieste and Fiume, with
respect to the traffic between the Danubian basin and the
Adriatic, in much the same relation as her Roman ancestress
stood to Aquileja. Siszek has two really busy seasons
in the year—in the spring when the maize crop
is gathered, and again the corn harvest in August and
September; and at these times her population, normally
reckoned at 3,800, rises to twice, or even, it is said, to
three times that number. The town, however, like many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
other sites of Roman cities, is not so healthy as it was in
former times, and a curious plague of emerods is epidemic
here. This decrease of salubrity is attributed by the
Siszekers themselves to the great destruction of forests
that has taken place in the neighbourhood; with what
reasons, let doctors decide.</p>

<p>However, modern science and drainage may probably
be trusted to remedy the present unhealthy state of the
Siscian atmosphere; and it requires no extraordinary gift
of prophecy to be able to foresee for Siszek a glorious
future, and to predict that, before many years are passed,
she will have done much to regain the splendour of
Roman Siscia, whose functions, as we have seen, she still
to a certain extent performs. For she has been dowered
with a situation destined by nature for a great emporium
of commerce, nor are signs wanting that the fulfilment of
her destiny is at hand. Already Siszek is fixed as the
point at which the railway that is to connect Western
Europe directly with Stamboul, and eventually perhaps
the furthest Orient, is to meet the lines leading to Vienna
and Trieste, and another line is projected, connecting
Siszek directly with the Adriatic.</p>

<p>Siszek used to be divided by the Kulpa into the civil
and military towns, the latter under ‘regimental’ government;
but since the new legislation the whole has been
placed under the municipal authorities. In neither half
is there anything worth seeing except the Roman remains.</p>

<p>On the bank of the Kulpa, however, just at the confluence
with the Save, about a mile from Siszek, rises the
old castle of Caprag, built in a triangular form, with a
round conical-roofed tower at each corner. This castle
brings home to us the old days when the Empire was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
engaged in a life and death struggle with the Turk. It was
built in the sixteenth century, with the Emperor Ferdinand’s
permission, by the bishop and canons of Agram,
and in 1592-3 it was gallantly defended against the
Pashà of Bosnia by two canons of the cathedral chapter;
till, after withstanding two sieges successfully, it yielded to
a third attempt, and for a year belonged to the Infidel.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a></p>

<p>As we were exploring the former military quarter of
Siszek, whose habitations, tenanted by the ordinary peasants
of the Granitza, are for the most part mere huts, as
compared with the more stylish houses of the civil town,
our ears were saluted by sounds of unearthly revelry
proceeding from a neighbouring wine-shop. Entering it,
we found ourselves in the midst of a Croat merrymaking:
an orchestra of four men strumming on tamburas and
tamburitzas as for dear life, and accompanied by such a
whisking, and whirling, and stamping as never was! The
dance they were engaged in when we went in was
known to them as the Kardatz, to the Germans as
‘Kroatisch’—though the Croats say that it was taught
them by the Magyars. Properly it was danced by the
women alone, but there were often enough male interlopers.
It is so pretty that it deserves to be known
beyond the limits of Croatia; so I will give the general arrangement
of the dance, as far as I could catch it.</p>

<p>Six Croat maidens—any number divisible by six and
two would do as well—sorted themselves into two groups
of three, which for awhile seemed to ignore each other’s
existence, the sisters of each triad alternately dancing to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
one another, and then joining hands, like three Graces as
they were, and circling round; till of a sudden the rival
orbits seemed to feel each other’s influence, a quick
<i>rapprochement</i> took place, and all six, interlacing their
arms, tripped round in a fairy ring, faces outwards, till a
starry disruption once more surprised us, and in a twinkling
the revolving orb was split up into a new triad of twin
constellations spinning round on their separate axes, till it
made one giddy to look at them—ribbons, kerchiefs,
and cometic plaits—and, sooth to say, the nebulous envelopes
of the statuesque!—flying off centrifugally.</p>

<p>The dance was in parts surprisingly graceful; and the
dancers, though mostly homely, were certainly prettier
than the average North-German <i>Bauerin</i>. Their hair
was inclined to light shades which one hardly expected
to see in so southern a clime, and their eyes were generally
blue. There was one maiden, however, more comely than
the rest, with dark almond eyes and raven hair, of a
strange type, that one meets with now and again in South-Sclavonic
regions; a waif from the lands of the morning,
an Oriental beauty shrouded in no winding-sheet and
entombed in no harem, but set off by the light white
muslin of Croatia.</p>

<p>Then there were other dances in which the men performed,
which were distinguished by stamping, and every
now and then interrupted by a comic ‘spoken.’ We
heard some songs, too; such as one would imagine might
break from a flock of sheep if they were to burst into
spontaneous melody—a wearisome succession of baa-baas,
varied at intervals by an attempt to see how long they
could keep on at one note! The poverty of the instruments
seemed to narrow the range of the human voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p>Next morning betimes we bade farewell to Siszek, and
took a passage on the Save steamer for Brood, from which
place we were to begin our foot journey through Bosnia.
During the early part of the voyage there was little to
see. Mud banks lined with willows, now and then villages
of dark timber, where, within the palings of the
large house-communities, were clustered together several
dwelling-houses of tea-caddy shape and somewhat pagoda-like
appearance, due to their having eaves projecting over
the ground-floor as well as the upper storey. The Save, as
we enter it, takes a muddier hue than the Kulpa, which
at Siszek possessed something of the emerald purity of a
limestone stream. Opposite the confluence of the Save and
Unna was Jassenovac, taken and held for awhile by the
Pashà of Bosnia in 1536, after the battle of Mohacz; it
is a small town of about 1,100 inhabitants, and, being
built on piles, is sometimes called New Amsterdam. It
might also recall the Swiss lake-dwellings, to restorations
of which many Granitza villages bear a certain family
likeness; but I doubt if the boats that float off Jassenovac
are not even more primitive than those of the old
lake-dwellers, for they are simply great oak-trunks
hollowed out in a Crusoe-like fashion. Further on we
passed floating mills, paddle-boats of Noah’s Ark-like
construction anchored in the current, or left behind us
large flat barges which looked like giant cockchafers
turned over on their backs.</p>

<p>We are now on the watery boundary-line between
Christendom and Islâm, and the contrast between the two
shores is one of the most striking that can be imagined,
recalling that between the Bulgarian and Wallachian
banks of the Lower Danube. On one side Croat men,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
white tunicked and white breeked, with blue vests, and
fringes of homely lace to their trowsers; bare-legged
women, with the shortest of apron-skirts, washing their
linen in the shallows, coifed in the rosy Rubatz. Now
and then a town, white houses and bulbous church-spires,
and citizens in the mourning hues of Western civilisation.
On the other bank minarets and narrow wooden streets,
gorgeous Turkish officials, brilliant maidens and mummied
dames, cheerful fezzes and red Bosnian turbans; and
it is to be remarked that the men on the Turkish bank,
owing to their wearing such comparatively shadeless
head-gear, are distinctly more sunburnt than the Slavonians
of the Austrian side in their broad, black, felt wideawakes.
The one side was cold and dull, if comparatively
clean; the other dirty but magnificent.</p>

<p>Various types illustrative of the South Sclavonic world
are to be seen on deck: a Syrmian woman of an Oriental
cast of feature already spoken of, with dark hair and eyes,
and a purple skirt; the grave hadji whose acquaintance
we had made at Siszek, who vouchsafes me a majestic
nod of recognition; a Dalmatiner—one of those Italianised
Sclaves who man the Austrian navy—with blue sailor-blouse
and bright red sash, sounds the shallows, when the
steamer slackens speed, with a long pole. A Slavonian
of that dissipated type which becomes more frequent as
we approach Syrmia, the mother-country of the famed
plum-brandy—the Syrmian slivovitz—with low eyebrows,
a ferocious moustache and an eminently Sclavonic nose,
is caught by our artist napping, and pocketed as below.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>
Beyond Gradisca we came to the prettiest part of the
river scenery, where the watery mirror reflects the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>
undulations of wooded hills; thence on and on through
this magnificent oak forest—some of the finest timber in
all Europe—the home of wolves and bears and sovereign
eagles, and a few days later to be the refuge of the panic-stricken
Christian refugees of Bosnia.</p>

<p>As we neared our destination the question arose
whether we should sleep in the Austrian or Turkish
town of Brood; but we decided, from a previous slight
acquaintance with a Bosnian town, that we were more
likely to secure sleep on the Austrian side, where, accordingly,
we landed and put up at the comfortable ‘Red
House,’ and presently went out to take stock of the place.
Slavonian Brood is a large wooden village, more abominably
paved, or rather cobbled, than any town I remember.
What especially struck us was the chimneys, which
are of every kind of shape and material, stone and wooden,
capped with canopies arched and peaked; and suggesting
in turn huts, towers, haystacks, tunnels, toadstools, and
umbrellas!</p>

<p>Now, whether it was the fact that we took out our
sketch-books to immortalise, so far as in us lay, these sooty
orifices, or whether in the way in which we eyed them
there was something of the insidious invader, certain it is
that our motions did not escape the observation of an
active and intelligent gendarme, who ‘knew directly,’ as
he afterwards expressed it to a Croat who gave us the
relation with great glee, ‘that we were Russian spies.’
Acting on which supposition with commendable alacrity,
he came up and demanded our pass. Now there is a
natural tendency amongst Englishmen to resent such a
demand as an antiquated absurdity; but our official was
so honeyed in manner, so profuse of ‘<i>bittes</i>’ and protestations<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
of ‘<i>Pflicht</i>,’ that we could not find it in our hearts to
refuse to satisfy the poor fellow’s curiosity. Whereupon
our friend looked at the paper and twisted it first to one
side and then to another; and as he did not understand
one word of it, shook his head very wisely and handed
it to his mate, who, not understanding any more, shook
his head more sagely still, and handed it us back, professing—sly
dog!—that they were satisfied.</p>

<p>Those chimneys were ‘the beginnings of evils!’</p>

<p>We, however, had not recognised the first drops of the
thunderstorm, and, proceeding tranquilly on our way,
strolled down past an old church and monastery to the
high bank overlooking the Save. It was a beautiful picture!—a
glorious sunset, crimson, golden, opalescent, mirrored
on the silvery expanse of quiet waters, broken only
by a small green island where stately oak-trees huddled
together in mid-flood like the giants of an older world;—far
beyond the sky-line, mingling with the mysterious
blue of distant mountains; on the Slavonian bank, pale
rows of poplars and conical haystacks, in relief against the
dark fringe of primeval forest; on the further side, a
verandahed guardhouse and the tip of a minaret—a fore-glimpse
of another world—and hark! as the sun goes
down, the solemn tones of the muezzin are faintly borne
by the evening breeze to the shores of that Christendom
which once rang with <i>Allah akbar</i>!</p>

<p>But we roused ourselves from the reveries which such
a scene could not fail to awaken, for the darkness was
gathering, and a voice within bade us seek the good cheer
of our inn; when we were arrested by the sounds of music
and the sight of a booth near the market-place, and, finding
that a peep-show was going on, paid our kreutzers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
and went in. A moonlight view of the Tuileries is hardly
what one would go to Brood to see, and we were beginning
to think the show a trifle dull, when the serenity of
the sightseers was broken in upon by the abrupt entry
of two police-officers, and from their evident designs on
some person or persons unknown we were congratulating
ourselves on the prospect of a more lively spectacle.
These expectations were indeed justified by the two officials
pouncing upon L⸺ and myself, and ordering us
to accompany them immediately to the Commissär of
Police.</p>

<p>‘Tell the Commissär of Police that if he wants to see
us he had better come himself,’ said I, who acted as our
spokesman.</p>

<p>‘Very sorry, sir,’ said the official addressed, ‘but our
orders were to bring you.’</p>

<p>‘Tell him,’ I said, ‘that we are Englishmen, and are
not accustomed to be treated in this way!’</p>

<p>Here a Slavonian gentleman intervened. He said
that there must be some misunderstanding; that it was a
most unfortunate occurrence; but, in fact, these men had
orders to arrest us if we did not follow them at once.</p>

<p>Evidently, to avoid a row, there was nothing for it
but to take his advice; so we were marched along the
streets of Brood with a gendarme on each side of us, to
all intents and purposes under arrest; till at last, in no
very accommodating humour, we arrived at the official’s
house, a long way off in the suburbs. Here we were
stumped through a court, and then ushered into a dirty
little room, where we found his highness seated at table
in his shirt-sleeves, chewing a Coriolanan meal of maize.
He did not get up from his chair to receive us, or even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
offer us a seat; but glancing at us in a way which made
us wish to knock him down and conclude the business
offhand, asked us in a surly and (we fancied) a slightly
husky voice who we were. ‘We are Englishmen,’ replied
I, in German. ‘Give me your pass!’ shouted the
Commissär in a still rougher tone; ‘what do you mean
by entering the town without reporting yourselves to
<span class="smcap">me</span>?’</p>

<p>To which I replied that he ought to know as well
as we did that travellers could pass from one town in the
monarchy to another without being subjected to such
annoying regulations; but that, so far as Brood was concerned,
we had as a matter of fact already shown our passes
to two gendarmes. What was more, we need scarcely
inform him that at the present time Englishmen could pass
into Austria, just as Austrians into England, without a
passport being demanded. ‘And I think, sir,’ I added,
‘as you wished to see us, it would have been more civil
if you had called in person at our hotel.’</p>

<p>A Polizei-Commissär, bearded in his den by tramps
and vagabonds like us—it was too much for his petty
Majesty! Any strictures on the ceremonial of his state
reception which I may have held in reserve, were cut
short by his roaring out, in a still more insufferable
tone, ‘I tell you I will see your pass!’</p>

<p>‘Sir,’ I replied, ‘just to prove to you that we <i>are</i>
Englishmen, and out of pure courtesy, we are willing to
show you our pass; but we must nevertheless protest that
you have no right whatever to demand it!’</p>

<p>‘No right!’ screamed the P.-C., almost choking with
rage, and bouncing from his chair with a spoon in one
hand, and a maize-stalk in the other. ‘<i>I</i> no <span class="smcap">right</span>!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
We’ll soon see about that. Take them off!’ he cried to
his satellites; ‘take them off, I say, to the lock-up.
Remove him!’—as I attempted to insert the thin end of
a protest, and hurled a few consuls, ambassadors, thrones
and dominions, at the official’s head; while the gendarmes,
seeing that it was a disgraceful business, hesitated to
carry out their chief’s commands—‘Do you hear me?
I tell you they shall pass the night in gaol. They shall
show me their pass to-morrow. Quick!’ And we left
him muttering ‘No right!’</p>

<p>Meanwhile rumours of the successful capture and
impending doom of two outrageous disturbers of the
peace had spread throughout the length and breadth of
Brood, and all Brood was rapidly assembling to see the
majesty of the law vindicated on our persons; so that
when we were led forth again by the police, we were
followed through the streets by a kind of funeral <i>cortége</i>.
Presently we turned down another larger court, and, ascending
some steps, found ourselves on a raised platform
outside the door of our intended prison, from which I
seized the opportunity of addressing a kind of scaffold
speech to the assembled soldiers and people, which at
least had the effect of delaying our incarceration.</p>

<p>I endeavoured to urge on them the seriousness of
what was about to take place. Two Englishmen, travelling
under the protection of a passport which they were
willing to produce, were about to be cast into a dungeon
on the mere fiat of a petty magistrate. That for ourselves,
gross as was the indignity, we regretted it principally
for the sake of the Polizei-Commissär. That it
would be but merciful to allow him a short space for
repentance; and here I sketched out vaguely some of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
tremendous consequences which such conduct might bring
down on his head. That they, too, the gendarmes, would
do well to think twice before lending a hand in such
a business. That Brood itself might rue the day; nor did
I neglect this opportunity to call up an apparition of a
British fleet on the Save. Finally, I enquired who was
the highest authority in Brood, and hearing that it was
the Stadthauptmann, or Mayor, despatched a gendarme
to beg that functionary’s immediate attendance.</p>

<p>We flatter ourselves that this harangue was not without
its effect on our audience, who mostly understood
German; but the minions of the law must obey, and the
police ushered us into a wretched cell some seven feet by
ten, quite dark, with a daïs of bare boards to sleep on.
We were allowed neither light, nor straw, nor water; and
when we asked for food—for we were very hungry, having
tasted nothing since noon, and it being now dusk—that
was also refused, till we offered a bribe to the officer, who
then saw the matter in quite a different light. He then
left the dungeon, the iron bolt grated in the lock, and we
prepared to shift for the night as best we might. Outside
we heard a voice of weeping, proceeding apparently from
a woman and a child, as if touched at our sad fate—though
L⸺ preferred to believe that the sobs were due
to the prospective annihilation of the Commissär. Had
our sympathisers listened, they would have heard a sound
of chuckling within, which might have been a considerable
relief to their feelings.</p>

<p>Yet, we had not dined.</p>

<p>But our threats had begun to work on the official
mind of Brood, and, as it afterwards turned out, they
were seconded by no less an advocate than the leader of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
the National party in the Croatian Diet, Dr. Makanec,
who, fired with that enthusiasm for the cause of freedom
which shortly after led him to secede with his party from
a bureaucratic assembly, made such representations to the
Mayor on the outrageous conduct of the Commissär, and
its probable consequences, as moved his worship to immediate
action.</p>

<p>Thus it was, that we had not been in durance vile
half-an-hour when hurried footsteps were heard in the
court. The door of our cell was thrown open, and the
Stadthauptmann was before us, bowing and scraping, and
entreating us with the most profuse apologies to step out.
He protested that it was an unfortunate misunderstanding,
and as he had not offended us we were the more ready to
grant him pardon, and permitted ourselves to be escorted
in triumph by his whole <i>posse comitatus</i> down the street,
his worship affecting the most polite interest in our tour.</p>

<p>Thus we returned victoriously to our inn, where we
were met by our host, who had been expecting us for
dinner for some time, with the expressive question ‘Eingesperrt?’
(‘Locked up?’) ‘Eingesperrt!’ said I. ‘So
was my waiter a day or two ago,’ continued our host.
‘What for?’ we demanded. ‘Ah! that I cannot tell
you.’ ‘The fellow ought to be shot!’ chimed in the
aggrieved waiter. It appeared that the Commissär was
a petty tyrant in the place, and our successful stand
against his insolence created everywhere in Brood the
liveliest sensations of delight. But why should the
Brooders have left it to stray Englishmen to beard their
despot? and which is the viler, the people who knock
under to such arbitrary treatment, or the government
which delegates to its officials the license to abuse the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
personal liberties of its subjects? This is not the first
time that, for an equally paltry charge, I have seen the
inside of an Austro-Hungarian prison. The free life of
the great cities of the empire deceives those foreigners
whose observations have been confined to the <i>Prater</i>;
what ought to be realised is, that while London in a
sense extends all over England, Pest and Vienna are
bounded by their suburbs. The truth is, that the Metternichian
régime has not died out entirely in the country
districts. But when, as I believe was the case in this
instance, the traditions of the ‘Police-State’ are followed
out by Magyar—or at least <i>Magyarizing</i>—officials, there
is less excuse for such conduct, and the Hungarians
should be warned that, by setting up an alien and oppressive
bureaucracy in their Sclavonic Provinces they are
not likely to retain the high opinion which their noble
stand against similar tyranny has won for them among
Englishmen.</p>

<p>We spent the next forenoon in exploring some of the
neighbouring house-communities, a description of which
has already been given; and about twelve, after a parting
wrangle concerning passports with a sentry on the river
bank, took our places in the ferry-boat that was to convey
us to the Turkish side of the Save. As the shores of
Christendom were receding from our view, we had leisure
to reflect on some slightly sensational topics which had
lately been forcing themselves on our attention. There
could be no doubt that the insurrection in the Herzegovina
was at least holding its ground, and that the agitation in
the neighbouring Sclavonic lands was increasing in intensity.
A revolutionary committee had already been formed
in Agram, at Laibach, Spalato, and other Austrian towns.
At Agram we came in for a concert in aid of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
insurgents; at Siszek there arrived the same night as ourselves
thirty Herzegovinians, who had left the employments
which they had in Free Serbia, and were hurrying
to aid their revolted brothers, while many Croats and
Slovenes from Agram, Marburg, Laibach, and other places
were—so the Siszekers assured us—also leaving for the
seat of war. Vague rumours of insurgent successes were
afloat, and Siszek was thrown into a considerable state of
excitement by a report that Mostar and Trebinje had both
fallen into the hands of the Christians. We were assured
from many sides that if the insurrection were to spread
a little further, the rayahs of Bosnia would rise also;
and fears were entertained for the safety of the Christian
minority in Serajevo, the capital of Bosnia, and the head-quarters
of Moslem fanaticism.</p>

<p>But what touched us more nearly was a proclamation
which had just appeared, signed by Dervish Pashà, the
Turkish governor-general of Bosnia, the authorship of
which the wily Vali, later on, thought fit to deny, but which
for the present had the desired effect. By it the whole of
Bosnia was subjected to martial law, as well as the Herzegovina,
and its terms were vague and comprehensive
enough to legalise any violence. ‘It is my will,’ so ran
the manifesto, ‘that every true believer in the Prophet
have the right to seize and bring before me anyone
suspected of taking part in the revolt, or of giving aid to
the enemies of our exalted master the Sultan. And I
order that all strangers direct themselves according to the
laws of the country during the insurrection, which probably
will not long endure, for already doth the sun of
the insurgents verge towards its setting. And assuredly’—we
were informed in the poetic imagery of the East—‘shall<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
the lightning of the Sultan strike all who order
not themselves according to my will.’</p>

<p>‘But as to those who harbour the unruly, by the
sword shall they be cut off; and in all God’s houses subject
to our jurisdiction shall prayers be offered up for the
help of God and the protection of the prophet, on our
exalted master the Sultan and his government.’</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>View on River Save, looking from Slavonian Brood towards the Bosnian Shore.</p></figcaption>

<p>But for better or worse our Rubicon is passed, and we
land on the Turkish shore, among a group of turbaned
gentry, from amongst whom emerges a somewhat tattered
soldier, who conducts us to the square, verandahed,
Karaula or guard-house. Here we are asked by another
official, in Italian, if we have anything to declare in our
knapsacks, and having satisfied him by a simple ‘Niente,’
we are again beckoned on by our soldier, and follow him
into the narrow street of Turkish Brood to show our
pass to the Præfect or Mudìr. Our appearance created as
great a sensation as was decorous among the big-turbans
of the townlet; crowds of Bosnian <i>gamins</i> followed at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
our heels; and we caught a passing glimpse of a dusky
Ethiopian maiden white-toothing us in the most coquettish
fashion from behind a door. As the Mudìr was not
at home, we had to wait in the front room of his Konak,<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>
if indeed a place which possesses neither door nor window,
and is completely open to the air on the street side, can
be called a room; and taking our seat on the platform or
raised floor—which in the other houses of the town, as
generally in Turkey, is used as the squatting-place of
the shopkeepers, and the counter on which to display
their wares—became the gazing-stock of a motley assemblage,
who, crowding round in the street, or taking
reserved seats in the melon-shop opposite, ‘twigged us’
at their leisure.</p>

<p>We, too, obtained a breathing space in which to
realise in what a new world we were. The Bosniacs
themselves speak of the other side of the Save as ‘Europe,’
and they are right; for to all intents and purposes a five
minutes’ voyage transports you into Asia. Travellers who
have seen the Turkish provinces of Syria, Armenia, or
Egypt, when they enter Bosnia, are at once surprised at
finding the familiar sights of Asia and Africa reproduced
in a province of European Turkey. Thrace, Macedonia,
the shores of the Ægean, Stamboul itself, have lost or
never displayed many Oriental customs and costumes;
but Bosnia remains the chosen land of Mahometan Conservatism,
the Goshen of the faithful, ennobled by the
tombs of martyrs, and known in Turkish annals as the
‘Lion that guards the gates of Stamboul.’ Fanaticism
has struck its deepest roots among her renegade population,
and reflects itself even in their dress. In no other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
European province of Turkey is the veiling of women so
strictly attended to. It is said that not long ago the fine
egg-shaped turbans of the Janissaries might still be found
in Bosnia, and the Maulouka, the most precious of all
mantles, which had died out elsewhere, long survived
among these Bosnian Tories. As to the introduction of
fezzes, the Imperial order almost provoked a revolt here;
and to this day among Mahometans the fez is almost confined
to officials, the rest of the believers going about in
the capacious turbans of the East.</p>

<p>The very darkness of the background, the dirty
narrow street, the timber houses, the time-stained wooden
minaret, acted as a foil to the Oriental brilliance of the
dress and merchandise, the scarlet sashes, the gold
embroidery, those gorgeous little maidens—doomed most
of them by sweet thirteen to take the winding-sheets of
Turkish matrimony, and bury their beauty in harems,
where by thirty-five they are turned old hags; but now,
poor little butterflies! fluttering out their brief child-glimpse
of the world—light-smocked, in linen chemises,
chevroned with rainbow threads of colour—bagged as to
their legs, but beflowered with roses of Shiraz—pranked
out with gilt coin-bespangled fezzes, whence fountain-like
the separate jets of their tresses trickle forth in a score of
silken plaits; Perilets, with sisterly arms round each
other’s necks, deigning to smile on the strange Giaours.
There, too, are their little brothers, showing more of
their slender legs, but gay as their sisters, in bags and
tunics, with pates not yet artificially baldened, but long-haired
as the little maidens, only in softer cascades, falling
down their backs, and fringing their foreheads. Capillati
(<i>Copi</i> is still the word for boys among the Roumans of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
East Europe)—one almost hoped to see a bulla round
their necks! and indeed I doubt not that they wore many
a potent spell against the Evil Eye.</p>

<p>There was one little lad of about five, with blue eyes
and hair of Scandinavian lightness, the cut of which
called up some tiny page of Charles the Second’s days,
who, with some of his playmates, crowded so near as to
shut out the view of the two mysterious Franks from the
grave and reverend signiors behind, whereupon a Turk,
who happened to hold a small switch in his hand, came
forward and flicked these small flies away. The whip just
touched our small urchin, who moved out of the way
with the others. He did not cry, but more, as it seemed,
in sorrow than in anger, fixed on his flagellator a look of
such childish dignity and grave surprise as should have
annihilated anyone less impassive than a Turk. It said,
as plainly as a look can speak, ‘I am not accustomed to
such treatment.’ The look of a child may seem a slight
matter, but it was eloquent of the tenderness with which
the Turks treat children—a tenderness which does them
honour. Such an unkind cut was a new experience in
the little lad’s life.</p>

<p>When our observers had taken sufficient stock of us,
the propriety of showing us into an upper room of the
Konak suggested itself to some of them, and we were
accordingly led upstairs, and invited to squat in a den
belonging to some subordinate official, who, while waiting
the Mudìr’s arrival, treated us to coffee. It was a very
dirty little room, in which the rags and tatters of an old
piece of faded carpet and rotten matting made shift for
chairs and sofas; these, with a stove such as has been
described already, pigeon-holed with pots, and a broken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
water-jar, completing the inventory of the furniture. After
a tedious delay, during which we supposed the worthy
præfect to be at his mid-day prayers, or more probably
his siesta, the Mudìr arrived, and we were ushered into
his room of state, distinguished from that of his sub. by
containing a larger area of dirt, and by displaying a
larger piece of carpet with a more capacious patch,
but also by possessing a greasy divan on which we were
beckoned by the Mudìr to take our seat by his side. Our
official had turned out in grey clothes of European cut,
and a regulation fez; but as he could only speak Turkish,
Arabic, and Bosniac, and as we could none of these, an
interpreter had to be found in the shape of an Italian-speaking
Dalmatian woman before we could hold much
communication. The Mudìr was well satisfied with our
Bujuruldu; but when we expressed our determination to
walk through the country, he was fairly taken aback. It
was evidently a case which had never before come within
his official experience. There was no precedent for such
conduct. Nobody, he assured us, ever thought of travelling
on foot in Bosnia; if we wanted a horse or
a waggon, he was ready to oblige—but to walk! We
had to explain that walking was a weakness of English
people; and at last, as I think the good man began to
believe that it was connected with our religion, and that
we were pilgrims of some sort, he gave over trying to
convert us to the Bosnian way of thinking, and told off
a Zaptieh to escort us to our that day’s destination,
Dervent. Our attempts to rid ourselves from having
this encumbrance failed, as the autograph letter of the
Pashà made him responsible for our safety.</p>

<p>We left Turkish Brood, after first mollifying our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
Zaptieh with a present of tobacco, and for a few miles
followed the road along the Save valley, stopping once
to purchase at a roadside cottage some sweet milk—<i>slátko
miléko</i>. I have come upon some of our Sclavonic
cousins who could understand the English word! The
homesteads were very like the Croatian and Slavonian
in general arrangement. The common yard and paling,
the wooden cottage roofed with long shingles, and the
various outhouses, were there, but the wickerwork maize-garners
were less capacious and more like large clothes-baskets,
and the whole was on a smaller scale. We
heard that the system of house-communities existed hereabouts
to a much less extent than on the Austrian side
of the Save, but here and there as many as three or four
families are to be found in the same homestead with a
common house-father and house-mother. Round each
cottage were a number of plum-trees, and in each yard
was a small distillery for making Slivovitz. Further on,
a Serbian merchant drove up in an Arabà or native
waggon, and courteously invited us to take a quarter of
an hour’s lift, which we accepted, though it was sad jolty
work, and we were not sorry to get out again.</p>

<p>Soon after passing a Turkish graveyard, with the
usual turbaned tombstones—some of the turbans of majestic
height—we turned off from the Save valley, and,
leaving the road, waded across the Ukrina stream, when
to our astonishment the Zaptieh, instead of following,
stood shivering on the brink; but our surprise was
turned to indignation when the fellow shouted to a
Christian woman, who was passing along the other bank,
to carry him across! We gave vent to such forcible expressions
of disapprobation as deterred the poor woman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
from obeying my lord’s commands; but a rayah man
coming up, the Zaptieh, notwithstanding our indignant
Jok! jok! (No! no!) succeeded in requisitioning him,
and in spite of all our gesticulations the Christian carried
over our escort on his back. When the Zaptieh saw that
we were very angry, he recompensed his bearer with a
handful of tobacco; and it must be owned that the
Christian seemed satisfied with the transaction, and that
neither the leggings nor the boots of the Zaptieh were
adapted for rapid disembarrassment.</p>

<p>Further on we ascended a gentle chain of hills by delicious
foot-paths across hayfields, or amidst luxuriant crops
of maize—through oak-forests, and, what was stranger,
woods of plum-trees laden with small unripe fruit; and
now and again along pretty country lanes, where the
hedges feasted us with a profusion of blackberries whose
size attested the richness of the soil, and whose flavour
seemed to combine all that was nicest in blackberry and
mulberry. Both fields and hedgerows were varied with
a beautiful array of flowers, amongst which I noticed
yellow snapdragon, sky-blue flax, a sweet flowering-rush,
and a heath of wondrous aroma.</p>

<p>About sunset we stopped at a small shed on the banks
of the Ukrina, where, seated among a group of Christian
peasants, we regaled ourselves with black coffee which
was being dispensed at the rate of about a farthing a
small cup. Hard by, fixed over the Ukrina stream, was
a water-mill for grinding corn, of the most primitive
construction, an idea of which is best given by the
accompanying diagram. These turbines are universal
throughout Bosnia, and are to be also seen in Croatia.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus17.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Plan of Turbine Mill.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The peasants here were mostly Vlachs, that is, they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
belonged to the Greek Church. The men wore red and
black turbans, a flowing white linen tunic like the Croats,
with a fringe of that coarse lace which we had noticed in
Slavonia. A leathern belt wound several times round the
waist served as a pocket for their smoking apparatus;
their trousers were worn loose and expansive as the Croatian,
sometimes close about the calf; their hair was sometimes
plaited together behind, and sometimes hung down
in two elf-locks—the crown of the head being shaven,
as with the Turks. As to the women, they were dressed
in light tunics and aprons, much as Croats and Slavonians,
but their hair was often plaited like the men’s into
a single pig-tail. On their head was a white kerchief arranged
in a fashion peculiar to themselves, with a flower-like
tassel at one side; and they usually wore in front of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
the two necessary aprons a superfluous black one with
long fringe. Here is a Greek Christian girl that we saw
at a well, and who graciously
allowed us to slake our thirst
from the bucket she had just
drawn up.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp56" id="illus18" style="max-width: 23.4375em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus18.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Bosnian Girl of the Possávina.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These Greek Church women
wore blue embroidery to
their dresses, but the Roman
Catholics of this part, though
dressing otherwise like the
Greeks, distinguish themselves
from their fellow-Christians by
embroidering their clothes with
red, while their men protest
against a Universal Church by wearing tighter breeches
than the Orthodox. It is hardly to be expected after this
that they should call the founder of their faith by the same
name; and, indeed, the Romanists call Christ ‘Krst,’ and
themselves ‘Krisčiani,’ while the Greeks speak of ‘Hrist’
and of themselves as ‘Hrisčiani;’ so that H in Bosnia
is a shibboleth. The Greek Bosnians use Cyrillian characters,
and call themselves distinctively Serbs or Pravoslaves,
that is, ‘the orthodox;’ the others look on the
Cyrillian character as a snare of the devil, and, far from
trying to claim fellowship with the people of Free Serbia,
style themselves Latins—‘Latinski’—for it always seems
to be a tendency of Romanists to thrust patriotic interests
into the background.</p>

<p>The Christian men dress much as the Turks about
here, or, to put it more accurately, the poorer Mussulman
Bosniacs have not much departed from their old Sclavonic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
attire; and though the Turkish townspeople show
themselves off in indigo bags and Oriental vests, their
peasants are often only to be distinguished from the
Christians round by a preference for white turbans.</p>

<p>We now crossed the Ukrina stream once more, by
means of a weir set up to increase the water-power of
the turbine, and presently struck again upon the road
just before entering Dervent, our halting-place for the
night, which rose up before us picturesquely perched,
with its two minarets, on a height above the river. Here
we were first conducted by our Zaptieh to the Konak of
the Kaïmakàm—a bigger personage than a Mudìr. But
we, mistaking the official residence for a hostelry, were beginning
to air our Bosniac in an attempt to order dinner,
when a demand for our Bujuruldu put a stop to these
indiscreet utterances. Leaving our pass at the Konak
for the night, to be digested at leisure by the authorities,
we found a real <i>Han</i>, and being shown an upper room,
with a few bits of matting and carpet stretched on the
divan to serve as beds and seats, were presently supping
<i>à la Bosniaque</i>. Our <i>menu</i> consisted of hot milk, a fowl
(pili), <i>chlébba</i>, or bread in shape of a round flat cake,
brownish and coarse and rather sour, but superior to the
black bread one meets with in German villages; <i>Méd</i>, or
honey; and the usual black coffee, all set before us in
tinned-copper dishes on a round tray of the same metal—the
<i>Tepšia</i>—as is usual in Turkey.</p>

<p>Our landlord could speak a little Italian, and we
found a very pleasant German Jew, who acted as our
interpreter and gave us what information we desired as
to the neighbourhood. From him we learnt that in
Dervent, of the population estimated at 2,000, about 40<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
per cent. belonged to the Greek Church, most of the
rest being Mahometan. Although there are no native
newspapers, a knowledge of the revolt in the Herzegovina
had spread among the Christians here by means of the
orthodox priests, but the rayahs were described to us as
too down-trodden even to wish to rise.</p>

<p>We shared our apartment with an Imâm, a Mahometan
priest, who dined opposite us from another tray,
having first most religiously washed his hands. The holy
man slept considerably sounder than we, who were unused
to this Turkish kennelling and its concomitants, and certainly
were not at all sorry when our Jewish friend roused
us next morning, to say that the Pashà of Banjaluka desired
us to pay him a visit at the Konak.</p>

<p>We found the old gentleman seated on a divan of
more sumptuous appearance than any we had yet seen,
with two other dignitaries, a Mutasarìf (probably of Banjaluka),
and the Kaïmakàm of Dervent. Two chairs
were brought for the ‘Europeans;’ and the Pashà, after
enquiring courteously about our travels, and giving us a
friendly message to our Consul, chose out for us a Zaptieh
after his own heart, who was to escort us on our
next day’s match, and whom he particularly enjoined to
obey us in everything, wait when we waited, and sleep
where we slept. His excellency was as fat and jolly a
personage as ever dined, and in a grey European dress,
with his measured English way of speaking, good-humoured
face, and hearty manner, he reminded us more
of a fox-hunting squire than a Turk; though there are
episodes in his life—and Ali Riza Pashà is an historical
character—which smack more of the Divan than the
hunting-field. He began his career as a soldier, but soon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
discovered that swash-bucklering was not his forte, and
that his nerves were better adapted for the arts of peace;
for, coming upon the Russians near Kars, he literally took
to his heels, and having the misfortune to be followed
by his men, was dismissed the army. But he had now
proved himself incapable, and accordingly became a natural
recipient of Turkish honours. In due course he was
created a Pashà, and received the lucrative post of Banjaluka,
where to this day, though he is unable to write
his name, he retains his office by administering heavy
bribes alternately at Stamboul and Serajevo. With the
Divan it has long been an <i>arcanum imperii</i> that the
more incompetent the official the greater his tribute of
bribery. At this moment our Pashà was engaged in
collecting troops to be employed, so it was said, against
the insurgents in the Herzegovina. But why were
they to be massed at Banjaluka, in a remote corner of
Bosnia?</p>

<p>Leaving the Konak, we took a stroll through the
streets of Dervent, and observed the wares, which may
be divided into two kinds—the Oriental and the English.
Many Manchester goods, Sheffield cutlery, and other useful
articles, find their way here from England by way of
Trieste; and we actually found in our chamber in the
Han a hair-brush with the name of an English maker on
it. The chief product of Dervent and its neighbourhood,
besides the Slivovitz, which every cottage makes for itself,
is dried plums. These plums are especially grown in
the Possávina—the part of Bosnia bordering on the Save—and
indeed form the principal article of the export of
the country, amounting yearly in value to about 40,000<i>l.</i>,
nearly an eighth of her total exports. They are shipped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
up the Save and then overland to Trieste, where they are
packed in wooden boxes, and thence find their way to
the Western markets, so that many of the inferior qualities
of the so-called French plums sold in this country are
really Bosnian.</p>

<p>At 8.30 we left Dervent, passing the shapeless ruins
of an old castle, two walls of which can alone be traced
now, and two mosques, one of them almost as dilapidated
as the castle wall. Our march lay through a beautiful
country, over the undulating hills which separate the
valleys of the Save and Bosna, beyond which, in the exquisitely
clear air, rose the lilac outlines of loftier ranges,
while every now and then a gap in the hills would reveal
to us the rich Possávina spread out below in dim vistas of
forest and cornland. We partly kept to the road, partly
indulged in short cuts and by-paths through a country
sparsely scattered at long intervals with huts and stray
maize-plots.</p>

<p>Then the scenery took a wilder aspect. We passed
through lonely woods of scrubby oak, and next set
to traversing long stretches of open land, relieved with
island-like patches and clumps, of nut-trees weighed
down by the fond embraces of wild vines. Rare commons
they were! and of varying mood; funereal with juniper,
or a-frolic with a bright array of butterflies—azure blues,
clouded yellows, silver-washed fritillaries, majestic swallow-tails,
rising in short flights, and then floating through
the air steered by their twin-rudders—they and all drinking
in the nectar which the tropical sun distilled from
seas of heath and bracken, till the whole air was filled
with a kind of subtle steam.</p>

<p>But butterflies have no knapsacks! and we ourselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
were glad enough to take refuge for a while from the
intense heat of noon in a little Han called Modran, where
we obtained a light refection, consisting of coffee and a
water-melon.</p>

<p>Beyond this we crossed a neck of land where the
oaks gave place to stunted beeches, and noticed by
the roadside two small tombstones. ‘Hajduks’ graves!’
ejaculated our Zaptieh. On one was engraved a Latin,
on the other a Greek cross, so they were the graves of
Christians; but how had they met their fate? Had
they turned brigands?—to redress, perhaps, some wrong
unutterable?—or were they rather the victims of some
outrage? For in Bosnia it is usual to bury the murdered
on the side of the road where they fall, and there are
other highways in the province lined with such monuments.
But the stones are hoar and without inscription.</p>

<p>We next passed a caravan of pack-horses heavily laden
with bales, and proceeding, like everything else in Bosnia,
at a snail’s pace, and then caught a glimpse of the Roman
Catholic church of Foca, a long straggling village lying
in a valley to the right. The village seemed to shrink
away from the high road, but one cottage was nearer,
and into the small yard of this our Zaptieh led us, to see
if we could procure any food. Here we found a
Christian woman with a small child, who, bringing
out two ragged pieces of carpet for us to lie on outside
her hut, did her best to prepare us a meal, and presently
set before us a couple of toasted maize-stalks, five eggs
poached in sour milk, some unripe plums, and unleavened
maize and rye bread. For all this she only charged us a
single ‘grosch,’ or about twopence, and seemed surprised
when we trebled that amount.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span></p>

<p>I can hardly describe the misery of the hovel and its
surroundings, the haggard mother and poor squalid brat,
scarcely better clad than when it entered the world,—the
all-wretchedest of homes—with earth for flooring, a few
stones in the middle to support the fire, above which
hung a piece of hooked wood to support a caldron,—a
small hole opening in the roof to let out the smoke,
which had covered the wooden walls with soot like the
inside of a chimney; a low partition shutting off the lair.
There was no light but what came in at the door, and the
few tatters she had strewn outside for us were the only
furniture. There was besides, a shed, in which we
imagined a cow, a small hen-roost, and a little patch of
maize; but how little of this ever went to the rayah who
tilled it was shown by the size of the garner, which was
a mere wicker-work basket. But the most indescribable
tokens of destitution were some clothes, or what once
had been such, hung to the fence,—they were mere
shapeless bundles of rags! We could not wonder much
after this that the rest of the Christian village shunned the
neighbourhood of the road.</p>

<p>Leaving this abode of misery we began to descend
into the valley of the Bosna, and pursuing a lane whose
hedges were brilliant with the scarlet sprays of wild vines—they
can take the gorgeous hues of Virginia creepers—we
arrived about five at a small Han called Radanka,
about an hour from Doboj, where we were glad to turn
in, and obtained much the same accommodation as the
night before. We were much amused at our Zaptieh,
who showed religious scruples against taking the sour
wine of the country, obtainable here, but drank copious
draughts of Arrack (Raki), and showed no objection to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
Rum. At Doboj, however, where we got good red Slavonian
wine, these scruples vanished.</p>

<p>Next morning we had a difficulty with mine host, a
German-speaking Slavonian, who charged us a ducat—a
monstrous sum for a night’s entertainment in Bosnia, and
over three times as much as we had paid at Dervent. Our
Zaptieh assessed us at half the amount, and we were preparing
to pay that much and be off; but the Hanjia had
the wit to lock up L⸺’s knapsack, so we had nothing
for it but to offer our host the choice of accepting our
terms, or the ducat he demanded, with the prospect of
being complained of to the Mudìr of Doboj. He chose
the latter alternative, and we left, our Zaptieh shouting
‘Hajduk Hanjia!’ (Brigand innkeeper!)</p>

<p>Our Zaptieh was, in his way, a very good fellow, and
we were pleased at the friendly manner in which he
treated the rayahs. His demonstrations of affection towards
ourselves and Englishmen in general were perhaps
a little too hilarious; for he kept shouting for miles at a
time that the Turks and English were brothers. He accompanied
us presently in a swim in the blue waters of
the Bosna, which is here so rapid that we had to choose
out a sheltered bay in which to disport ourselves. About
half an hour after, resuming our trudge, on passing a turn
in the road, the old castle of Doboj rose before us, finely
seated on a conical hill.</p>

<p>We found a Han in the lower part of the town, and
then visited the Mudìr, whom we found seated on a small
but neat and brilliant divan, and to whom our Zaptieh
poured forth the story of our Hanjia’s extortion. We
have some reason to believe that two Zaptiehs were dispatched
to enquire into the matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span></p>

<p>We now ascended the hill to explore the upper part
of the town and the castle. The main street is an undulating
and snaky mud-path, along each side of which are
ranged the usual unglazed shops, in which English cottons,
knives and scissors, and European-labelled bottles containing
various spirits, are mixed with gold-embroidered
Turkish apparel, and a variety of
tinned-copper salvers, and water
vessels of coffee-pot shape. In one
shop were for sale rude hand-mills
of this shape for grinding salt.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus19.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Diagram of Salt-mill.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But the wine shop carried one
back to some tavern of antiquity. It
displayed a wooden bar facing the
street, covered with an array of jars, ‘<i>testjas</i>’ as they are
still called hereabouts, Roman alike in shape and name,
behind which the vendor stood and filled brimming cups
and jars with thick red wine for the passers-by. The
whole scene called to mind a more classic wine-bar, as it is
still to be seen on the monument of a Gallo-Roman taverner
discovered at Dijon.</p>

<p>We now directed our footsteps to the old castle that
crowns the summit of the hill. The ‘Starigrad,’ as it is
called here, is one of the most interesting historic relics
in the whole of Bosnia. A glance from its mouldering
walls makes one realise the importance of its situation.
The peak on which the castle of Doboj stands juts out
abruptly into the valley of the Bosna just at the point
where in one direction the Sprecca opens out an avenue
towards the Drina and Serbian frontier, and in the other
the pass of Dervent conducts the road to Croatia. The
castle, therefore, was the key to the whole valley of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
Bosna against a foe coming from the Hungarian plains,
and commanded the highway through the province of
Ussora to the very heart of the Bosnian kingdom. The
maize-covered river-flat that spreads below it seems one
of those spots destined by nature to be the battle-field of
nations; and the very name of Doboj or Dvoboi, as it
was formerly written, means in Bosniac ‘the two fights.’</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Old Castle of Doboj.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As Prince of Ussora, this castle belonged to Tvartko
I., who first erected Bosnia into a kingdom. He entrusted
the stronghold to the safe keeping of the Croatian
Ban, John Horvath, with whom he was bound by common
jealousy of the Hungarian suzerain. It was within its
walls that the Ban, the bishop of Agram, and the King of
Bosnia, concocted, in 1387, the plot by which the
Hungarian queen and queen-mother were seized, and the
Croat and Bosnian magnates revolted against Sigismund,
the King of Hungary. But Sigismund was victorious,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
and in 1391 the Ban and bishop were shut up within
the walls of Doboj,<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> and captured; the Ban while attempting
to escape, the bishop in the castle itself, which
was forced to surrender; while the King of Bosnia, seeing
his province of Ussora overrun, was forced to return to
his allegiance. In 1408 another revolt, under Tvartko
III., against the Hungarian suzerain, was crushed under
these same walls, and the King of Bosnia himself captured
in the battle. A terrible vengeance now followed, and
180 nobles, Bosnian and Croatian, are said to have been
executed within these walls, and their bodies thrown into
the river below. This was at a time when both Hungary
and Bosnia should have been united against the Turkish
invaders. But the sad national tragedy was being played
out, and in due course Doboj, the key of the Christian
kingdom, became the stronghold of the Turk. It is a
place full of dismal associations for the Christians of
Bosnia; they seem to shrink instinctively from the ill-omened
site, and at this day the population of Doboj is
almost exclusively Mahometan. We could not wonder
at coming upon a tradition among the rayahs of this
neighbourhood that it was within these walls that the old
Bosnian nobility forswore their faith and country and
renegaded to the Infidel.</p>

<p>Under the Turks the castle appears to have long since
fallen into the decay in which it now moulders. Prince
Eugene seems to have found no difficulty in taking it <i>en<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
passant</i> during his hasty dash into Bosnia in 1697; and
in 1717 it again fell for awhile into the hands of the
imperialists under General Petrasch. At the present day
even the Turks recognise it as a ruin, and apparently
throw no obstacle in the way of those who may wish to
explore it. We, at any rate, entered the old fortress unopposed,
passing through a now broken archway, the
former outer gate of the castle, which opens on its least
precipitous side upon the neck of the hill where the present
upper town of Doboj is situated.</p>

<p>We now found ourselves in the outer yard, between
the castle and the exterior walls, in a kind of covered
causeway leading to the inner gateway of the castle itself.
Here, groping among the rubble, we discovered an old
cannon of apparently very early date, with two dolphins
forming handles—an ancient trophy, we liked to think,
from the Venetians; but though we looked carefully
about the walls and fragments for any inscriptions or
elegant details of architecture, we hit on nothing except
an old square stone with an almost effaced chevron moulding
round it, set in a dark and inaccessible position in
the wall inside the castle-gateway, and which may have
had some further device on it. Entering by this gateway,
the arch of which is of ogival shape, we passed the
remains of what may have been the dwelling-house of
some former Turkish commandant, now in a state which
makes it dangerous to the passer-by. Then clambering
up among the more ancient and massive ruins, we came
upon an old chamber in the wall, with a barrel-vaulting,
where we discovered a quantity of rotten musket-stocks,
which must have been mouldering here for centuries, and
a small arsenal-full of stone cannon-balls, such as from
time to time turn up on Bosworth Field. Further on we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
came to the tower which forms the northern corner of
the castle, which is tolerably perfect inside, and in shape
resembles a halved octagon. There appear to have been
two other towers at the two other corners of the castle,
which in shape is triangular; but I will not attempt more
than a rough plan of this medley of ruins, which, half-concealed
with brambles and wild vine, and tufted in every
crevice with maidenhair and rue-fern, are more picturesque
than intelligible.</p>

<p>Having returned to our Han, we found our Mudìr
seated on a divan in one of the rooms, which was strewn
with bright Roumelian carpets, in general character very
like the Slavonian. He knew no tongues but Bosniac,
Arabic, Turkish, and modern Greek; but though I succeeded
in describing to him our visit to the castle in the
language of Thucydides, we found it on the whole better
to make use of our host—a Montenegrine by birth, who
has picked up a little Swabian—as an interpreter. The
Mudìr told us that the Turkish government were anxious
to dispose of the old castle as an eligible site, or a useful
quarry for building purposes. Shade of Bosnian kings!
Our Mahometan, with the greatest <i>sangfroid</i>, ordered a
bottle of thick red Slavonian wine, and proceeded to consume
it before our eyes; but the wine-bar in the upper
town had already familiarised us with the laxity of true-believers.</p>

<p>As the Mudìr could not understand German, the
Montenegrine, who was an ardent Southern Sclave, could
give vent to his patriotic sentiments without reserve. He
literally devoured our map of the Herzegovina, and entreated
us to sell it him. He believed the insurrection
would be successful, and had heard that Mostar was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
blockaded—for rumours of the first slight successes of
the insurgents in the Narenta valley had penetrated in
an exaggerated form to the extremities of Bosnia. We
asked if he believed that the Christian Bosniacs of the
neighbourhood would rise?</p>

<p>‘No,’ he answered; ‘I have little hopes of them—they
are a poor lot!’ but (pointing to the mountains of
the south-east) ‘out there, about Dolnja Tuzla, and along
the Serbian frontier, there is a finer race of men; <i>they</i>
will join their brothers against the Turkish swine! We
think that even you English will leave the Turks to their
fate this time.’</p>

<p>I said that there were other European nations from
whom the Southern Sclaves had more to fear than from
England.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ he continued; ‘we know the ambition of
Russia; but we don’t want the Russians to lord it over us
any more than the Turks! no, nor the Austrians either.’</p>

<p>While sketching the Starigrad I had another proof of
the kindness with which the Bosniac Turks treat children.
A small boy of about seven came up in the most fearless
manner and stated for my benefit that a plum-tree was
called ‘sliva,’ and a house ‘kuca,’ all which and sundry
other items of information the little man volunteered
without the slightest sign of distrust at my outlandish
appearance. As I took a last twilight glimpse at the
mournfully historic castle a star was setting beneath its
topmost parapet, as if to betoken that the dreams of
patriots were vain and the hopes of Christian Bosnia had
set for ever.</p>

<p>We passed an unquiet night, owing to swarms of
gnats, which droned about our chamber and forced us to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
cover our faces with nets; and were up, and, with a new
Zaptieh who had been assigned to us by the Mudìr, on
our way again almost before it was light, bound for
Tešanj, the old capital of Ussora. For an hour or so we
still followed the valley of the Bosna, which is here very
beautiful, the timber finer than any we have yet seen in
Bosnia, tall poplars and magnificent oaks crowning the
banks or chequering the emerald pools with their shadows.
On each side of the valley rose the slopes of the low forest-mountains,
usually at a gentle incline, but at one point
a sheer cliff of the most brilliant limestone—snow-white
as Parian marble—towered above our path. This was
just at the point where the Ussora torrent runs into the
Bosna, and here we left the main road and turned off
towards Tešanj by country lanes, following for some time
the right bank of the Ussora. On our way we twice
stopped to refresh ourselves at wayside cafés, which are
simply rough sheds—four poles supporting a thatch of
leafy branches—beneath whose shade sits the coffee-maker
with a supply of copper pots, earthenware <i>testjas</i>,
and brilliant little cups of about the capacity of an ordinary
wine-glass. Round the shed run planks raised about a
foot from the ground, which serve the wayfarer as a
divan on which to quaff the black powdery thimblefuls,
or to demolish huge slices of water-melon. As we walked
on we were much struck by the tameness of the magpies,
which would settle just before us, and let us approach as
near as if they were domesticated pigeons. About two
hours from Tešanj we left our valley and gradually ascended
a wooded range which rises some 1300 feet above
the Bosna, where the beeches became larger—a forest of
thick pollard stumps, which gradually gladed out into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
luxuriant heather-land, deliciously perfumed with ferny
incense, from which opened out our first panorama of the
mountain-peaks that form the heart of Bosnia. In the
blue distance rose the dominating cone of Vlašić, but there
were no grim Alpine giants, no glacier seas, no jagged
horns of rock. The speciality of the mountains was rather
their softness of contour. What was quite strange to us
was the aërial clearness, the refined delicacy of the
colouring—turquoise, lilac, and faint pervading pink.</p>

<p>As we were preparing to begin our descent from these
uplands towards Tešanj, some large white objects amongst
the heather on a neighbouring hill caught our eye, which,
on investigation, we found to belong to a curious prehistoric
monument of the kind popularly known as Druidic.
It was an alignment of large oblong blocks along the
neck of the hill; but the stones, unlike those of Stonehenge
or Carnac, were laid on their faces, and not set upright.
The blocks, which were composed of limestone and conglomerate,
had in most cases been roughly squared, and
the largest measured seven feet by four. The chain extended
between two knolls of the hill-top, and on looking
along it from the lowest of these (see diagram, p. 112),
it presented a wavy and serpentine appearance, which
may have been due to the slight inequalities of the soil.
At one point near this end rose a small hillock capped
by a larger than ordinary block of snow-white limestone,
in form hexangular, and with some of the facets deftly
hewn (see diagram). Before this on either side were two
smaller and flatter slabs of rock, arranged apparently
with some special reference to the block between them,
and which gave me the impression that it had been meant
to serve as an altar; though whether these stones were
set here by heathen Sclaves or by one of the earlier races
of Illyria, and with what object, it would be hazardous
to conjecture. By the peasants about they are known as
the Old Stones—Stari Stéona.</p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span></p>

<p>Nearing Tešanj we came upon, and partly followed,
the remains of an ancient road, roughly paved in such an
antique fashion as to remind me of the streets from time
to time exhumed on the sites of Roman towns. Perhaps
it really in some way represented the continuity of Roman
engineering. Certain it is that the wooden bridges, such
as the one on which we crossed the Ussora, and others
that we were afterwards to meet with, with their beam-work
arches and supports and their lattice railings,
strangely recalled some of Trajan’s handicraft. The
Bosnian waggons—not so unlike, either, in form, the <i>gementia
plaustra</i> of antiquity—as they rumble along the
old-world roads and bridges, with creaking so loud and
stridulous as literally to make woods and rocks re-echo
with their wailing, bring before you another feature in
the country life of classic times, which in the England of
to-day it is hard to realise. With such discord piercing
your ears, there seems new point in those exquisite lines
of Martial which describe his friend’s garden as not too
near the highway—‘ne blando rota sit molesta somno.’<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
Heard from afar the sound is not so unpleasant, and might
be mistaken for the plaintive whistling of the wind; but
if any one wants to know what it is like at close quarters,
he had better tweak a young pig’s tail and listen.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus22.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Castle of Tešanj.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The view which now broke upon us was the most
beautiful that we had yet set eyes on in Bosnia. It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
best seen by climbing the high rocks which start up
above the little Tešanška Rieka. Below you winds the
gorge of the shallow stream, its steeps and narrow meadowland
shaded with orchards and plum-woods, amongst
which peep out the chalet-like roofs and slender minarets
of the truly Alpine town of Tešanj. But all this only
forms an avenue to a bold rocky height which leaves the
town clinging to the two sides of the valley and towers
up in the middle in isolated grandeur, crowned with the
old castle of the Bans of Ussora, whose walls on one side
frown over an overhanging precipice on to the sources of
the rivulet several hundred feet below. It is more perfect,
but not so open to investigation as that of Doboj,
being still made use of by the Turks. Like the other it
is triangular, and ends in a polygonal tower, which here
is capped by a conical roof. Below this tower are some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
subsidiary fortifications and a solitary tower, in general
effect not unlike the Campanile of St. Mark at Venice on
a small scale.</p>

<p>Parts of the castle are probably of great antiquity.
Indeed the magnificence of the position would point it
out as a stronghold in any age. Tešanj is in fact one of
the earliest Sclavonic strongholds in Bosnia of which
we possess any record, if we may be allowed to
identify it with the Tesnec mentioned as a Serbian
town by Constantine Porphyrogenitus in the tenth century.
It was the residence of the Bans of Ussora, and
probably of earlier Župans, the former area of whose
jurisdiction seems to be still indicated by the name Župa,
which clings to this mountainous triangle between the
Bosna and the Verbas. When Ussora became a province
of Bosnia, and Bosnia a kingdom, Tešanj was therefore
a royal castle, and it was probably one of the seventy
strongholds ‘defended by nature and art’ which fell
into the hands of Mahomet II. during those terrible
eight days which followed the capture of the last Bosnian
king in 1463. Soon afterwards, however, when Matthias
Corvinus restored Northern Bosnia to Hungary and Christendom,
and made of it the Banat of Jaycze, Tešanj
was again set free from the Paynim yoke. But it fell
into the custody of the Voivode, whose carelessness lost
Zvornik to the Pashà of Upper Bosnia in 1520. The
Pashà, regardless of terms of capitulation which he had
conceded, ‘keeping,’ as the Bosniacs bitterly expressed
it, ‘Turkish faith,’ butchered all except the young
or the beautiful, who might be useful for the harem or
the Janissary camp. When the people of Tešanj, and
they of Sokol, another fortress held by this Unready,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
heard of the miserable fate of the Zwornikers, a panic
seized on them, and, setting fire to the castle, they fled to
the mountains, though it is said that few escaped the
Turkish sword. With Tešanj<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> one of the keys of Lower
Bosnia was lost, and the Banat of Jaycze did not long
survive this disaster.</p>

<p>At present Tešanj has some importance as a centre of
the corn trade, and though containing but 30,000 inhabitants
at the outside, is a seat of a Kaïmakàm, a more
exalted governor than a Mudìr, to whose sumptuous white
Konak we now made our way. As we approached it we
found the whole place buzzing with peasants, who were
issuing from the Konak in troops, and we were obliged
to wait some time in an antechamber, where we were
at liberty to exchange a few remarks with a good-natured
Italian-speaking official, before we were admitted to the
great man’s presence. When we were admitted we found
a very civilised being in thin white clothes of European
cut, and who but for his fez might have been mistaken
for an Italian. He looked dreadfully bored, and not
without reason, for he had been reviewing hundreds of
peasants all the morning; but he was extremely courteous,
and treated us to the usual coffee and cigarettes. Paper
cigarettes!—twenty years ago they would have been
narghilés, ambery, Oriental, ablaze with gold and jewels,
enchantingly barbaric; but their date is fled; the West
advances and the East recedes; and now, even in Conservative
old Bosnia, the pipe is degenerating into the
symbol of a fogy! <i>Sic transit gloria mundi.</i> It was to be
observed that the Kaïmakàm’s coffee-cup was twice as big
as ours; but, as L⸺ remarked, ‘<i>we</i> could not well complain.’<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
We were able to converse with him, as we found
that he could speak French ‘full feteously.’ On our enquiring
what the large assemblage of peasants meant, he
explained that he was collecting the Redìf or reserve,
adding incidentally, for our information, ‘Nous avons
une petite guerre dans l’Herzek.’ But why, we asked
one another again, were the reserves to be sent to Banjaluka?</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus23" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus23.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Turkish Café, Tešanj.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The Kaïmakàm attached a new Zaptieh to us, with
orders to find us suitable lodgings in the town. What
was our dismay when he led us into a dark and filthy
stable!—but following him up a ladder we emerged on the
landing of what we afterwards learnt by experience to be
the typical Bosnian inn, in which the whole ground floor
is set apart for horses. Our room was fairly clean, but
infested with an ambuscade of carpeting; and our host,
who was a Roman Catholic, soon provided us with a meal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
of which the principal features were hard-boiled eggs,
flat cakes of very fair bread, and a curious Asiatic dish of
clotted cream called <i>kaimak</i>, which in Bosnia varies
according to the local cuisine, from an approach to
Devonshire cream to the mere scum of boiled milk, and
is sometimes mixed with little lumps of honey or sugar.
From here I adjourned to a neighbouring café, discovered
by entering another stable and climbing another ladder,
leaving L⸺ to the safe keeping of our Zaptieh, who
was snoring on the floor of our room. I found myself
amidst a bevy of comfortable Turks, who were alternately
sipping their mocha and smoking their long chibouks,—for
they belonged to the old school, and were robed in
flowing dressing-gowns and surmounted with pompous
turbans.</p>

<p>In exploring the streets—which are narrow and filthy,
though sweeter than those of many a North-German
town!—I was struck once more with the extraordinary
jumble of wares exhibited in each store. Instead of one
shopman reserving his energies for haberdashery, and
another for confectionery, and so forth, you would come
upon a goodly row of Turks, squatting hopefully on what
is equally the floor and counter of their several shops, each
of whom set up to supply his customers with turbans,
coffee-cups, knives, boots, tobacco, carpets, Turkish delight,
gun-flints, water-melons, and amulets against warts;
so that it was rather confusing to decide which shop to
go to if you wanted to suit yourself with anything, and
you could not be certain of getting the best tobacco
where you had observed the nattiest sandals! Amongst
the wares, wax, which is one of the principal articles of
Bosnian export, formed an important item; and besides<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
these miscellaneous stores there were others more exclusive,
some of which were set apart for the sale of salt, exposed
in massive cubes. But though there are prolific
salt-springs not so very far off, at Dolnja Tuzla, towards
the Serbian border, it must not be assumed that these
were native products, for Bosnia prefers to import her
salt from Galicia, Dalmatia, Sicily, and Wallachia. But
the shop which most took my fancy was the blacksmith’s;
it was quite irresistible to see a grimy old Turk in a majestic
head-piece—there is something comically incongruous
between a turban and a sledge-hammer!—alternately
working the beam of his bellows and hammering
away on a primitive anvil, fixed into a rough section of
oak trunk.</p>

<p>While trying to make my way to the other side of
the valley I found myself hemmed in by a variety of
fences, which I was forced to surmount, and run the
gauntlet through private orchards, with whose owners I
happily avoided an encounter, and finally emerged with
a whole skin on the Christian quarter, which lies east of
the castle. The inhabitants here belonged to the Latin
Church; but though the Roman Catholic priesthood in
Bosnia leans towards Croatia, and shrinks from Serbia with
more horror than from Stamboul, yet these Latin women
of Tešanj betrayed, perhaps unconsciously, their sisterhood
with the heretics beyond the Drina. They were
not coiffed Croat fashion, in a kerchief, like the peasants
we had seen in the Bosnian Possávina, but their hair was
plaited round a fez, <i>à la belle Serbe</i>, with flowers stuck
in coquettishly on one side, and drooping gracefully
about the ear. They displayed, too, the Serbian partiality
for purple, and a maiden with a scarf crossed over the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
bosom recalled the peasant girls about Belgrade. The
rest of their dress—the double girdle, the twin aprons,
the tunics with expanding sleeves—may be described as
South Sclavonic. The men, though surmounted
with turbans, differed usually
from the Turks in wearing a white tunic
in place of the gorgeous vest and jacket,
and short flowing white trowsers instead
of indigo bags. Those Christian men,
however, who were more well to do,
and inhabited the mercantile part of the
town, were, like our landlord, in complete
Turkish costume.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Latin maiden of Tešanj.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As it was now near sunset a large
assemblage of the neighbouring girls and
housewives had gathered together at a
spring to draw water and gossip. I found them very
friendly, except one old woman, between whom and myself
a most unfortunate disagreement arose. The cause
of our tiff was that I—being, as the reader may have perceived,
curious in pots and pans—so far trespassed on the
old lady’s forbearance as to attempt to pocket—not indeed
that antique and ponderous utensil itself—but a sketch of
the water-pot, which, after duly filling at the spring, she
had in just confidence laid down, the better to gossip
with her coevals. But chancing to turn round, and seeing
the outline of her ‘tikvo’—for that was the name by
which she knew it—transferred to my paper, the old
woman’s fury knew no bounds; and taking the law of
copyright into her own hands, she snatched up the outraged
vessel and soused a good portion of its contents
over my person. She then emptied out what few drops<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
remained—she would have none of your ‘water bewitched’!—and
hastily refilling her pot, left in a huff. It
appears that she had taken me for a sorcerer, and had
been piously desirous of exorcising the devil within me
by a baptism of a rough and ready sort. Her motives
may therefore have been honourable to her head and
heart, though such misconceptions are sometimes unpleasant
at the time. Meanwhile, here is the tikvo, and two
other vessels which I succeeded in drawing without any
enforced lustrations—one of a gourd-like shape, common
in Southern Europe; the other a water-jug like a coffee-pot,
of the tinned copper which in Bosnia greatly supplants
earthenware.</p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Pots from Tešanj.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>There is a sad side, too, to that episode of the old
woman in the intense ignorance and concomitant superstition
which it reveals. In other parts of Eastern
Europe I have met with just the same repugnance against
allowing me to take representations of animate or even
inanimate belongings. In Wallachia I once nearly felt a
peasant’s whip for attempting to sketch his horse. In
other parts of Bosnia I have found natives who refused
to allow me to sketch them, even when I offered them
money if they would let me do so. I can only refer it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
to a wide-spread underlying belief in the Black Art,
and especially that grim outgrowth of Fetishism which
our old friend Thomas Ingoldsby places so vividly before
us in the ‘Leech of Folkestone.’ The almost
universal use of amulets and talismans, of which more
will be said later on, is but symptomatic of the same
superstition, and its adoption by the rayahs is chiefly
due to the same Oriental influences which are traceable,
in more ways than one, in their everyday life.</p>

<p>While returning to our Han from the spring I witnessed
a good instance of the way in which Mahometan ideas
touching the seclusion of women have taken hold of
the rayah mind.</p>

<p>As I was proceeding along a lane between some
cottage enclosures, I happened to pass a Christian
woman on the other side of the palings, and certainly
on the wrong side of forty. So far was I from staring
at her that I had hardly noticed her in passing, till
she screamed after me, ‘Hai’ ti! Hai’ ti!’ ‘Quick; be
off!’ a usual expression of veiled Mahometan women in
Bosnia if passed too closely on the road; and on my
looking round to see if anything was the matter, she repeated
these expressions with increased emphasis, and,
rapidly raising her voice to cockatoo pitch, gave vent to
the enquiry, which, though couched in not too courteous
terms, few visitors to Bosnia remain long unacquainted
with—<i>Što glédaš?</i> ‘What are you staring at?’ The
view was certainly not very attractive, and as she seemed
inclined to follow up her remarks with some more practical
demonstration, and I myself was anything but desirous
of crossing the path of a second Bosnian virago on the
same afternoon, I beat a hasty retreat, venturing, however,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
to think that it would have been better if she had
carried out her Oriental principles to their logical conclusion
and veiled herself entirely. The rayah women of some
parts of Bosnia—about Pristina, for example—actually
go so far as to do this. I found that L⸺ had been
faring worse than myself; for in attempting to penetrate
along another lane he was received in front and flank
with such a volley of stones as repulsed him with loss.</p>

<p>Next morning, hearing that the Kaïmakàm wished to
see us before we proceeded on our way, we visited the
Konak about seven; but were obliged to waste nearly
two hours of a time of day most valuable to pedestrians,
waiting for the great man. While we were thus doomed
to loaf, a very learned-looking Effendi of the Kaïmakàm’s
divan came up and solicited permission to look through
our spectacles, exchanging the compliment by lending us
his own, which we found to our surprise to be made of
plain window-glass, and even that, partly owing to dirt
and partly to its inferior quality, was anything but crystalline,
and positively obscured the vision. But he probably
found them useful in impressing the Kaïmakàm
with a due sense of his erudition, and he certainly succeeded
in focussing his subordinates with them most
effectually. The worthy man’s delight on looking through
spectacles that really aided the sight was something
childish, but we were not inclined to accept his overtures
for a swap.</p>

<p>At last the Kaïmakàm himself appeared, attired this
time in a light white suit of most correct cut. He was
evidently a Turk of the new school, and showed a most
intelligent interest in our map, which he understood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
perfectly, and pointed out on it the route of the new
railway which has just been begun in Bosnia.</p>

<p>He was all politeness; but when we sketched out our
projected mountain route to Travnik, and added moreover
that we were going on foot, he betrayed such a
desire to dissuade us from our purpose as convinced us
that he had some misgivings as to our object in visiting
the country, and that he more than half suspected us of
being insurgent emissaries of some kind. When we expressed
our intention of making Comušina, a small Christian
village where there is a Franciscan monastery, our
that day’s destination, he began to urge all kinds of
obstacles to our plan. There was no road—the country
was impassable—we should not be able to procure any
food, and it was impossible that we should ever find our
way to Travnik by this route. Let him persuade us to
go round by Zepše, and then follow the high road; he
would see that we were provided with a good arabà (a
Bosnian waggon)—or would we prefer horses?</p>

<p>We, however, remained firm, and our pass from the
Vali being imperative, there was nothing for it but to let
us have our way. The game, as he thought, was played
out; and further concealment being useless, he dropped
his objections with admirable tact, and mentioned incidentally
that we should come in for a large Christian
gathering at Comušina—‘<i>Ce que peut vous intéresser</i>.’
He evidently believed himself that we knew all about the
gathering already, and I do not blame his suspicions; for
the moment was far more critical than we had any idea
of, and to the mind of even a liberal Turk our design of
leaving the road and plunging into the mountains was, on
any other hypothesis, sheer insanity—for anything that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
we might protest about the English passion for scenery
and mountaineering. We afterwards discovered that in
addition to the Zaptieh whom he forced on us as guide
and guard, another was despatched to Comušina with an
express commission to observe our movements.</p>

</div>

<p>At last we made our escape from the Kaïmakàm, and,
escorted by our new Zaptieh, began ascending the Crni
Vrch, or Black-Mountain, named, like the Crnagora (Montenegro),
not from any blackness of the rock, but from
being covered with dark forests, or simply from its savage
wildness, ‘black’ being with the Sclaves synonymous with
everything harsh and fierce. About an hour and a
quarter’s ascent brought us to one of its summits, when
we passed a Mahometan woman, who, though veiled,
went through the absurd formality—common enough
among the Bosniac Mahometans—of squatting against
the roadside with her back turned towards us till we had
put a sufficiency of road between her and ourselves.
Further on we came to a shed such as we had seen in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
vale of Ussora, where we regaled ourselves with coffee,
and a chubby kind of cucumber, which however our
Zaptieh was the only one to fancy.</p>

<p>Beyond here the scenery became wilder and indescribably
beautiful. On one side rolled out beneath us the
Possávina and the winding vale of Bosna, and far beyond
the dim ranges of Slavonia; on the other side rose the
peaks and shoulders of Vlašić and Troghìr and a tossing
sea of low mountains, the nearer billows green with the
fine forest growth, into which we now plunged—and
to quit the scorching sun of noon for woodlands still
fresh with the dewy coolness of night is indeed to take
an aërial bath! The beeches amongst which we now
steered our course, by a meandering forest-path, were no
longer gnarled and stumpy, but tall and queenly, as
those of an English park. Amongst them, here and
there, towered isolated oaks, champions as it seemed of
a lost fight, tough rugged old barbarians, battling every
inch with those civilised victorious beeches—hemmed
round but unyielding—heroic, taking every attitude of god-like
struggle—here a manly, muscular Laocöon, wrestling
with serpentine brambles and underwood, that insinuates
itself among the knotted limbs—a mighty Hercules, uplifted
arm and club as to fell the hundred-headed Hydra—or
there sovereign Jove, the Thunderer himself, hurling—so
the jagged branches interpreted themselves—forked
lightning at the beechlings round! But in vain. The oaks
must be content to reign in plain and valley. On these
uplands the beeches camp triumphantly, till higher still
the pines repulse them from the mountain citadel, and in
the great struggle for existence each tree finds its own
level.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>But how soft the refrain from this deep bass of
nature! Pale, dreamy tufts of male and lady fern, delicately
luminous in the forest-depths, Canterbury bells — for
English pilgrims, what fitter accompaniment?—vibrating to
the zephyrs in the orbs of sunlight; brighter still, the ruby
coronals of sweet-williams; and, where it should be, among
its native mountains, luxuriant gentian, drooping like
Solomon’s seal, weighed down as with elfin vases of lapis
lazuli. This is the flower of Illyria, which, as Pliny tells
us, took its name from her last king—that Gentius who
ruled these lands in the days of Perseus of Macedon, and
who first brought into credit the virtues of the herb
which now alone preserves his memory.</p>

<p>Now and then we emerge on a glade of breathing
bracken—from the leafy orchestra round, the myriad
chirp of tree-crickets, caught up below by blue and red
winged brothers, who, in their glee, half skipping and half
flying, seem amphibious of earth and heaven—a ‘kingly’
minstrelsy, as beseeming the rank and beauty of the butterfly
dancers. Amongst the company we noticed a purple
Emperor, Dukes of Burgundy, majestic swallow-tails, a
cream-spotted tiger-moth—beauties of Camberwell—not
to speak of blues and lesser stars—marsh fritillaries and
delicate wood-whites, hovering over damper hollows; and
in one dark watery dell ‘edged with poplar pale,’ a black
and mysterious butterfly, which I am content to leave
within the limits of the Unknown. It is not for me to
enquire into the transformation of such sooty insects—<i>nec
scire fas est!</i>—for we are now treading enchanted ground—we
are actually on the skirts of earthly fairyland.
Yonder dark forest mountain, unfathomable as it seems,
is called by a name which the Bosniac woodman still<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
mentions with awe. It is nothing else than the Vila Gora—the
fairy mountain. Yes! even within the limits of
Europe the nymphs of the old world have something
more than twilight thickets for their mourning; here at
least they have still some sunny glades and laughing
runnels left them for their merry-go-rounds. We are
now in a land where the fairies live not only in the lays
but the minds of men—and malicious sprites some of them
are, sable as that mysterious fly! As the peasant gropes
his way through yonder haunted pine-wood, the trees
begin to drip with grisly lichen, the trunks grow scarred,
and sooty with storm and lightning, and a cloudy pall
obscures the sun, and a sudden gust of wind rattles the
bony limbs above—and lo! across the gloomiest forest-crypt,
lashing her coal-black stag with serpent scourge,
shoots—<i>the Evil Vila</i>!</p>

<p>But let us be chary of such ill-omened words! and
pass on rather to that flowery dell among the beech-trees
where the good Vilas are dancing. In form they are as
beautiful maidens with ever-loosened zones. Their eyes
are blue as the heavens, and their hair, which falls even
to their ankles, golden as the sunlight. Some are riding
through the forest on wind-swift steeds. They are
singing the fates of men; they are weaving destinies;
they are watching with motherly tenderness over the
slumbers of the heroes of the race, who, lapped in their
bosoms, are dreaming on of better days in many a mountain
cave, till the guardian nymph shall rouse each
warrior from his sleep, to sunder for ever the chains of
the oppressors. Methinks they are waking even now!</p>

<p>Once or twice our ears were saluted with strange
idyllic strains, harmonising with the scenery, and we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
passed by swineherds recumbent beneath spreading beech-trees,
and piping to their bristly charge on barbaric instruments.
We chose a shady chestnut-tree by a stream, under
which to cook our frugal repast (for though nature was
bountiful of blackberries we could not live on them), and
while so engaged a shepherd lad came up and serenaded
us with Bosnian airs on his rude double pipe or Svirala.</p>

<p>We now followed a small tributary of the Ussora, and
in its shallow bed made our first acquaintance with the
mineral wealth of the country. It was a brilliant mosaic,
a medley of vermeiled jasper, snow-white quartz, fragments
of rich iron ore, glittering scales of mica, green serpentine;
and we picked up a beautiful piece of opaline chalcedony,
enwrapping a nest of little crystals in its agaty
folds. The hamlet near the point where this rivulet runs
into the Ussora is known as Zlatina, which means golden,
and is a name commonly given throughout Bosnia to
places where gold is popularly supposed to exist; but
though there are many old gold mines in different parts,
and gold is still washed in some of the rivers, the ignorant
peasants are said to mistake sulphur for it, or perhaps
more probably the interior of iron-pyrites—our ‘crow
gold’—so that the name itself proves nothing.</p>

<p>Beyond here we forded the Ussora, and now began to
fall in with long trains of Bosnian rayahs, a troop of small
Bosnian horses laden with bales and human beings, all
streaming in the same direction as ourselves. It was
evening when we began to ascend a small wooded mountain,
escorted by this motley troop; the women and
children mostly on foot, the men usually on horseback,
and with their bright red turbans—worn about here by
even the poorest classes—forming a brilliant foreground<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
to the surrounding foliage. We followed the current,
and an hour’s winding ascent brought us to the summit of
a mountain, normally lonely, and devoid of habitation, but
now thronged to overflowing by a gorgeous array of
peasants from the uttermost recesses of Christian Bosnia,
and some even from beyond the Serbian frontier. The
summit of the mountain formed a long flat neck capacious
enough to accommodate many thousands, and rising to its
highest point towards its north-western extremity. As
each detachment of peasants arrived they tethered their
horses, and made straight to the summit of the ridge,
which was surmounted by a rude shrine. This was the
central point of the vast assemblage, and the reason of
this great Christian gathering was soon explained.</p>

<p>The Roman Catholic population of this part of Bosnia
had assembled from their mountain strongholds far and
wide to do honour to two of their saints, known in their
own parlance as Svéta Góspa and Svéta Kátta—Our
Lady and St. Catherine; St. Mary the patroness of the old
Bosnian kingdom, and St. Catherine the favoured Virgin
Martyr of Bosnian Queens. To-morrow was the feast
of the Miraculous Assumption, and the pilgrims had
thronged to this Christian Delphos, the sacred navel of
their land, in a great crisis of their national history, if
not to consult saintly oracles, at least to obtain the
support of their two tutelary goddesses. Though we
realised it not at the time, we were on something more
than the eve of a Romish feast. On the very day of this
great pilgrimage, while these thousands were praying
before their mountain shrine, a revolt was beginning in
Bosnia, of which we have not yet seen the end, and
which, for better or worse, must change her whole future.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus26" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus26.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Pilgrims at the Shrine, near Comušina.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This is what happened at the shrine. On arriving,
each peasant bowed reverently before it, and executed
certain mystic passes connected with his religion. He
then made his way step by step round the outside of the
shrine, moving, as they say, with the sun, from left to
right; and if he were particularly pious or particularly
conscience-smitten, he stumped round on his knees. On
the right or northern side of the shrine a priest standing
within it held forth a gilt crucifix, which each passer-by
kissed; and having performed the circuit of the exterior,
each votary entered the shrine itself and completed his
devotions before barbaric pictures of his divinities which
were facing east—laying, it might be, on the altar a
homely nosegay of rosemary and golden zinnias. Many
devotees, after leaving the mysterious canopy, remained
facing it outside, as represented in the sketch, on their
knees, counting their beads or holding out their clenched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
fists in a peculiar attitude, intended, perhaps, to represent
a cross. Some prayed very earnestly; and indeed the occasion
was no ordinary one. When each had finished, he
left the immediate neighbourhood of the shrine and joined
the multitude below, so that the grassy slope around the
building, which was a rude wooden shed, was reserved
for those actually performing their devotions. This
sketch was drawn on the eve of the festival, when the
shrine was less crowded.</p>

<p>But what was most striking was the thoroughly Mahometan
appearance of so many of these Christian devotees.
The influence of Islâm seemed to have infected even their
ritual; for many grovelled on the ground and kissed the
earth, as in a mosque. There was one man whom I should
have mistaken for a Hadji or Turkish pilgrim; there were
others with the shaven crown of a true-believing Moslem,
and the single pig-tail, so thoughtfully preserved by the
Faithful to aid the Angel Gabriel in dragging them into
Paradise. There were women with faces so nearly eclipsed
that they seemed in fear of the injunctions of the Koràn;
and even the monks who had come up from the monastery
of Comušina might be mistaken at a little distance for
Turkish officials. There was something pathetic in the
sight of so many Christians, dressed indeed in the garb of
Mahometans, but still clinging to the faith of their fathers!<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>
Indeed, the whole scene was one which, though well-nigh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
impossible to describe, no one who had seen it could ever
forget, and in which even those who lament the superstition
must acknowledge some elements of grandeur
and beauty;—the solitary mountain-peak, momentarily
thronged by pilgrims who in some childish yearning after
heaven had pitched their place of worship here so as to be
nearer their celestial goal—the votaries themselves—these
poor peasants, brutalised by centuries of misrule, steeped
in ignorance and bigotry, outcasts of this world rapt in
silent communings (as they believed) with another and a
happier; beneath them the primeval forest; around in
every direction an aërial gulf; and beyond, far as the
eye could pierce the deepening twilight, range upon range
of lonely mountains.</p>

<p>Not but what these thrifty Bosniacs had turned the
opportunity to account by combining with their religious
festival and pilgrimage a large fair—or, as the Germans
would say, a year-market—which occupied the other end
of the mountain neck. A long lane was formed along
which to arrange the wares, but the show was mostly
reserved for the <i>festa</i> itself on the morrow. On each side
of this lane the peasants were camped in families; and in
the festivities of the night and the fair next morning we
saw displayed before us, as in some brilliant picture-book,
the whole life of the rayah country people from a large
tract of Bosnia: their varying costumes, their simple diet,
their cheap necessities, their dances and discordant minstrelsy,
and over all, the shadow of a Damoclean scimetar.</p>

<p>As the night drew on the whole neck of the mountain
was lit up by cheery bonfires, round which the peasants
clustered in social circles. Our Zaptieh provided us with
blazing logs for ourselves, over which we performed our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
own culinary operations, supplemented by a generous
haunch from a sheep, roasted in the usual Bosnian fashion.
This is how the peasants cooked their meat—for on this
high-day there were some who indulged in such a luxury
as mutton. They took a sharp stake about eight feet
long, and inserting it in the slaughtered animal’s mouth or
neck, skewered it right through the carcase and out at the
tail. Two low forks were now driven into the ground, the
huge spit with its burden was lodged on them, a large fire
was kindled over against it, and the peasants took turn and
turn about to make the spit go round. A goodly portion
of the assemblage seemed determined to make a night of
it, and what with carousing, dancing, singing, and playing,
I will not deny that they succeeded.</p>

<p>The first dance I saw was of a comic kind, performed
by two men, and there were so many varying figures that
one fancied they must improvise them as they went on.
The accompaniment on a ghuzla, the one-stringed lute
of the Serbs, was of the dolefullest, and the dance itself
was anything but graceful. The chief object that they
apparently had in view was to dislocate every limb in
the most comfortable way possible. Now and then they
stamped on the ground, and then walked after each other
and round each other in a clown-like fashion; and now
and then they would pause and tread gingerly with
their feet, as if they were trying whether ice would
bear, fumbling the while in a stupid way about their
noses, as if to see that spectacles were safely fixed on them.
The Kolo, however, or round dance of the Sclaves, was
more elegant, and chiefly danced by the girls, who formed
themselves in a ring and danced round and round, sometimes
in a very spirited manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span></p>

<p>The most monotonous of all the dances was that with
which some Turkish officials, who had fixed their quarters
at the further end of the mountain neck, solaced themselves.
Not that they danced themselves! they were far
too lazy and phlegmatic to do that; but they impressed
into their service a succession of rayah boys, who in turn
danced long <i>pas seuls</i> before their lords and masters.
Without leaving what we may call his pedestal, a boy
kept treading the ground to the weary see-sawing music,
and trying to make every muscle and limb quiver like a
jelly. Then, after performing this operation for a good
ten minutes, with his face towards his Turkish admirers,
he slowly turned round on his pivot and danced—if such
tremulous distortion could be called dancing!—for an
equal space of time, with his back to the spectators, and
then he gradually swerved round again as if he were roasting
before a slow fire, and was from time to time adjusted
by a turnspit! But the Turks, comfortably squatted on
carpets strewn over the turf, gazed gravely on by the hour
together, and seemed to enjoy the spectacle.</p>

<p>We heard much playing of ghuzlas and double pipes
and flutes, and much vocal accompaniment with lyric
songs and long epic ballads. The instruments, with the
exception of the ghuzla, were the same as the Croatian
already described, and the ghuzla itself resembled a tamburitza
with three strings and bow in place of fingers; but
the playing on them struck me as slightly better than
what we had heard at Siszek. The metre was as curious
and as much a relic of an older world as the instruments
whose Arcadian affinities have been already touched on.
One of the many minstrels was enchanting an audience of
Bosniac maidens with a lyric, whose measure, unless my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
ears deceived me, was identical with that of Anacreon’s
song beginning,</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">And it was strange and impressive, with the air merry
with tree-crickets from the foliage around, to catch, as it,
seemed, the cadence of that exquisite ode in which the
Teian bard paid his homage to the same cicadas!</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But the songs, though interesting, were not beautiful,
and, to tell the truth, were often more like a succession of
street-cries than any other sound, human or divine! This
was mainly owing to what was the chief peculiarity of the
singing—the long stress, namely, laid by the voice on the
last syllable or the last trochee, insomuch that success in
a singer seemed to lie in the ability of keeping on at the
concluding howl longer than his fellows.</p>

<p>One asks oneself with amazement how such dolorous
chaunts could possibly have originated? Was it possibly
the dire necessity of droning in concert with a bagpipe?
The ‘<i>dudelsack</i>’—pitilessly expressive word!—is not unknown
in Bosnia at this day, and was certainly as much
the property of the primitive Sclave as of the primitive
Englishman. Doubtless, too, early singing is pinched and
crippled and distorted by the rudeness of early instruments.
I did not see a bagpipe here, but traced its evil
communications everywhere. It seemed to have corrupted
all the other instruments. They had caught it. It had
got into their throats like a fog, and given a twang to every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
chord. It was a positive nightmare of bagpipes. There
was a bagpipe in the flute, and a bagpipe in the lute,
and a bagpipe even in the whistle!</p>

<p>The singing, at any rate, reacts on the poetry; for the
long expenditure of breath renders a pause a physical
necessity for the recovery of wind at the end of every
two lines, so that the lays were generally divided into
couplets. Much that looks Procrustean, and many apparently
capricious full-stops in classic metres might, one
would think, be referred to similar causes. Nearly a
minute would sometimes elapse after one couplet before
the singer had recovered breath to continue.</p>

<p>But what carried one back into epic days at once
was a larger gathering, forming a spacious ring lit up by
a blazing fire, in the middle of which a Bosniac bard
took his seat on a rough log, and tuning his ghuzla began
to pour forth one of the grand sagas of his race.
Could it have been an unpremeditated lay? Without a
book or any aid to memory he rolled out the ballad for
hour after hour, and when I turned to rest, not long before
sunrise, he was still rhapsodising. I do not pretend to
know what was the burthen of the ballad. Perchance it
recorded the enchantments of the Vila in yonder forest-mountain;
perchance it told how Czar Dūshan marched
to seize the city of the Cæsars; or of the finding of Knez
Lazar and the sad day of Kóssovo; or, mayhap it belonged
to that later cycle of Serbian poetry which centres round
the half-hero, half-renegade, Marko Kraljević.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> For in
this land, without books, without history, it is these heroic
lays—Tabories they call them, from Tavor, their God of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
War—that keep alive from generation to generation the
sacred traditions of the race. In the days of bondage
these have been the one proud heirloom of the Serbian
people from the Adriatic to the Danube. Their spirit has
been continually refreshed from the perennial fount of
epic song. Separated by creed and the barriers of nature,
and the caprice of man, it is this national poetry that has
kept them from forgetting that they are brothers, that
has turned their mind’s eye back from the divisions of the
present to the union of the past, and has fed their ambition
with the memories of a time when one of their princes
seemed about to catch up the falling diadem of Byzantium
and place it on his brow. For the Bosnian Serb seems to
forget the narrower traditions of his half alien kingdom
in these more glorious legends, which override the cant
of geographers and diplomatists, and make him see a
brother in the Serb of the Black Mountain or Old Serbia,
or the free Principality; and, indeed, he too has some
claims to share these memories, for the city of the Serbian
Cæsars, Prizren the Czarigrad, lies within the Bosnian limits.</p>

<p>Doleful, then, as these strains may seem to a civilised
ears, it ill becomes the stranger to mock at them. Over
those rude men they seemed to exercise a kind of charm.
The hearers of the bard to whom I was listening seemed
never to grow weary. Every now and then an ecstatic
thrill would run through the whole circle, and find utterance
in inarticulate murmurs of delight. So carried away
are the emotions of the listeners, that it is by no means
rare—though I did not witness this;—for them to be
moved to tears. ‘I cannot describe,’ says an observer,<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
‘the pathos with which these songs are sometimes sung.
I have witnessed crowds surrounding a blind old singer,
and every cheek was wet with tears; it was not the music,
but the words, which affected them.’ For these songs
speak to the heart. They are instinct with that natural
simplicity which is the very soul of pathos. True, there
is lacking something of the tremendous energy of our old
Teutonic sagas. There is less sword-play; but there is
more poetry. We should never expect to find an Anglo-Saxon
gleeman of our epic days likening, as does one of
these unlettered Bosnian bards, the cheeks of the loved
one to the flush of dawn and her eyelids to the silken
wings of swallows. This airiness of phantasy, the brilliance
of the imagery, seem to witness the close communion of
the race with the Oriental world around them; but there
is a national sobriety ever bridling the imagination, just
as we have seen the Oriental gorgeousness of a Serbian
lady’s dress tempered with something of the homely
Serbian house-mother. But what, perhaps, is more striking
than all, is to find the rude simplicity of Homer combined
with a dramatic force more characteristic of the age of
Euripides.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Surely in such spring flowers—and wintry
indeed has been the spring of this poor Bosnian stem!—is
to be found the best proof that the stock is not all
cankered, and the surest earnest of fruits to ripen yet. In
a poetry that has received the reverent homage of Goethe
it cannot be fanciful to see a token that the race is capable
of attaining to the highest pinnacles of civilisation. It
can hardly be unreasonable to seek here for a retort<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
against those who speak of the South Sclavonic rayah as an
utterly degraded being, and who cannot discern that</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that I am unable to conclude the
account of this—to me—uniquely interesting night with
the mention of songs and ballads, and that more must be
added which it is most displeasing to relate.</p>

<p>It is only just to say that, taking into consideration the
troubles in the Herzegovina, and—what may have been
traceable in the hurried calling-out of the reserve at
Dervent and Tešanj—the possible foreknowledge of the
imminence of an outbreak in Bosnia, it was quite natural
for the Turkish authorities to view with suspicion an
assemblage of several thousand Christian Bosniacs, and
even to take precautionary measures against any disturbances—or
conspiracy. No one can therefore blame the
Kaïmakàm of Tešanj for despatching some officials and a
retinue of gendarmes to watch the proceedings. This
night the Turks had taken their station at the end of the
neck of the hill, as if the better to ward off any possible
attack, and to secure a line of retreat if necessary. The
presence of these Zaptiehs gave me an opportunity of
observing how these tools of the Mahometan government
dealt with the Christian Bosniacs, when not under the
immediate surveillance of foreign consuls. Briefly, they
treated them like a herd of cattle; and it is hard to say
which was the more revolting, the intolerable insolence or
the downright cruelty.</p>

<p>I was standing in one of the circles where a Bosnian
gleeman was rehearsing a national epic, when the spell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
of the song was rudely broken by a Zaptieh, who, bursting
through the ring of listeners and thrusting the rayahs to
right and left, stood before the embers in the middle, and,
playing with his cutlass with one hand, demanded, in
such a savage tone as quite infuriated me, who would
light his pipe. The Bosniacs took it more calmly. The
old minstrel laid down his lute and paused for awhile in
his lay. For a few moments there was a moody silence—as
if some blunted sense of injury had outlived long use
of wrongs—then a fine man stepped forward sheepishly
and lit the bully’s pipe.</p>

<p>Another time a knot of peasants were gathered together
in friendly converse in the grassy middle-lane, when two
Zaptiehs rushed forward with whips, and flogged them
away, <i>women</i> as well as men! But the worst instance of
brutality that came within my observation took place while
I was discussing a bottle of Slavonian wine, and exchanging
English songs for Bosnian, with a merry group of
rayahs, belonging mostly to the Greek Church, ‘Serbs,’ as
they proudly called themselves, who had come to take
part in the fair and festa of their Roman Catholic rivals.
Of a sudden our festivities were broken in upon by the
sounds of a scuffle behind, accompanied by such shrieks as
made me start up, and the firelight fell on a gendarme—the
same, I think, who had interrupted the minstrelsy—who,
with a stick or some kind of weapon, was beating an
old Christian man as if he were a pig, and kicking the
poor cringing wretch the while till he howled for mercy.
I was stepping forward to interpose, but two Bosniacs
clutched hold of me and held me back, whispering with
more covered hatred than can be described, ‘’Tis only the
Turks!’ The Zaptieh, however, not wishing to provoke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
Frankish intervention, desisted from his belabouring, and
left his victim to limp away as best he might. The group
of ‘Serbs’ had not shown any sign of attempting a rescue,
but I saw more than one brow knit ominously for the
moment. But the visible emotion was transient, and their
faces relapsed into that impassive stolidity which is the
normal expression of the Bosnian rayah.</p>

<p>It has been already observed that a Zaptieh had been
told off with the express commission of observing our
motions, and it was a continual annoyance to find a gendarme
ever dogging at our heels. But it was obviously
disagreeable to the Turks that I should be about at all;
and as the night advanced our detective began to find
the duties of espionage somewhat wearisome, and appears
to have put our own Zaptieh, with whom I noticed him
confabulating, up to bidding me retire to rest, as if he
were rather commander than escort. This he did to my
no small astonishment, while I was listening to one of
the ballads, and was sent roundly about his business
for his pains, to the unconcealed delight of the Christians,
who from that moment dubbed us Consuls—a name given
by the Bosniacs to any Europeans who are not subject to
the caprices of Turkish gendarmes; for they argue that no
one less than a foreign representative would dare to lift
a finger against these creatures of their tyrants.</p>

<p>But at last, though the epic still rolled on—sometimes
these rhapsodies continue with intervals for days at
a time!—and though the interest of the audience flagged
not, I thought it time to follow the example set hours
before by L⸺, who was somewhat footsore, and to lie
down beside our fire. And if anyone fancies that our
mountain lair was altogether a bed of roses, he is mistaken,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
for the night was very cold, and we were always
being partly scorched and partly frozen; and as the ground
was anything but even, falling asleep was rather a doubtful
advantage, since we were pretty sure to roll either into
the embers on one side, or down the steep on the other;
and if neither of these casualties befel us ’twas odds that
we started up with a most corporeal and hoofy nightmare
upon us, and discovered that one of the Arab horses,
which encompassed us round about, had mistaken our
blanket bags for fodder, and was proceeding to act upon
that assumption.</p>

<p>But it begins to dawn, the vast camp is astir, a subtle
aroma of coffee pervades our waking senses, and a new
day breaks forth, wondrously fair to look upon, but to
Bosnia pregnant with bloodshed and misery.</p>

<p>Yet there is no sign of trouble here. New arrivals
are perpetually swelling the festal gathering and crowding
round the shrine. It was a brilliant scene, which
no words can convey; but the reader will permit me
to introduce the characteristic group seated on yonder
trunk.</p>

<p>The man to the right, in a red turban and a dark
indigo jacket, is a fair example of the Bosniac rayah of
these parts, and indeed his dress is much the same
throughout the country. He wears a loose white linen
tunic and trowsers, which latter are confined about the
calf in this instance, though they are often loose and flowing,
as among the Croats. His feet are sandalled in the
never-failing <i>Opankas</i>, which seem common to all the
southern Sclaves, and may not improbably be the same foot-covering
as that mentioned by Constantine Porphyrogenitus.
The Byzantine Emperor says that the Romans<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
called the boots of the Serbli (or Serbs) Serbula, and
Serbulianos all those who were poorly booted; and indeed,
if these are the sandals alluded to, it must be confessed
that the Byzantine contempt for them as boots was merited,
for experience has taught me that the straps easily break,
and that the soles are worn through in no time.</p>

</figure>

<p>The woman seated on the middle of the trunk is
representative of the ordinary Latin peasants hereabouts,
the red border of her jacket being probably an ensign of
her Catholicism as near Dervent. The rest of the jacket
is black, contrasting with the clean white tunic below;
but the general effect would be funereal were it not for
her apron, which is of as divers colours as Joseph’s coat,
and displays those diamond patterns so much affected
by the peasants near Belgrade. The twin brooches
on her belt may remind the antiquary of those worn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
by our Anglo-Saxon great-grandmothers, or of such as
are exhumed from old Serbian graves, and the silver
work of her ear-rings is doubtless an inheritance from
Byzantium.</p>

<p>The standing figure to her left belongs to a very
curious type both of feature and costume. This was the
first occasion on which we came upon a dress the affinities
of which were other than Serbian or Croatian. The
multitude of decoration is overpowering. She is studded
with Turkish coins as with a cuirass of scale armour, her
arms loaded with bracelets, and her fingers with rings;
ornamental patterns are crowded over her jacket and
apron,—a gorgeous orange being the pervading colour.
Her hair was spangled with coins in a way which we
afterwards saw repeated among the unveiled Mahometan
women of the Narenta valley. There was a certain heaviness
about the dress which contrasted with the lighter
costumes around; it belonged to the general class of
Bosnian costume extending west and south towards
Dalmatia and the Herzegovinian frontier. Its <i>nuances</i>
are decidedly Dalmatian. As we crossed the mountains
towards Travnik we came upon more specimens of this
type; and in the gorges of Troghìr and Mazulia were
again struck by the curious stamp of features, which in
these mountains seems always to accompany this peculiar
attire. The broad face and flat nose suggest quite a
different parentage, and I noticed brothers and husbands
who showed that the peculiarity was not confined to one
sex. I remember one man in particular with nose so
curiously flattened that one was almost tempted to believe
that his profile had been deformed by a bandage drawn
tightly across the face in childhood, after the old Hunnish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
fashion, and went on to speculate whether some of the
followers of Attila, or perchance some of those Tartars
who flooded Bosnia in the thirteenth century, might
not have been caught in these mountain basins. But this
much is certain, that at the present day these gorgeous
barbarians speak Bosniac like their neighbours.</p>

<p>To the left of our Hunnish friend sits a woman in the
most civilized costume of Christian Bosnia, and which,
with peculiarities of its own, is eminently Serbian, of the
Danube, and will recall the maiden of Tešanj. Here,
however, besides the hair plaited round a tasselled fez,
and the scarf crossed X-wise over the bosom, is the
expanding skirt and the fur-bordered jacket, such as the
ladies of Belgrade delight in wearing.</p>

<p>Some of the girls have decked their hair with zinnias
and even sunflowers. The quantity of false coral and
bead necklaces worn is overpowering, as is the endless
variety of modes in which the white and red kerchiefs
that drape the heads are set. Sometimes it was arranged
not unlike the coiffure of the last queen of Bosnia, as
she appears on her monumental slab. Sometimes, as has
been already noticed, it threatened to conceal the face
entirely, and some of these half Mahometans were to be
seen with the ‘bags’ reaching to their ankles, <i>à la belle
Turque</i>. One girl was arrayed as a bride—in lily white,
except the flowers in her hair, which just peeped forth
from beneath a kerchief-veil, woven of the lightest
texture of the country, and falling airily about her
person, fringed with simple lace.</p>

<p>But another maiden demands my presence, and I am
called away to sketch, at her own request, a Bosnian belle,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
coiffed in the brightest of rosy kerchiefs, enveloped in
a jacket with the most gorgeous golden border, and
cinctured with a sash of orange and purple. Whether
the attitude in which she sat for her portrait was
the most elegant she could have chosen, and whether
her boots, in which I fancy she took a peculiar pride,
were of that form most adapted for displaying maidenly
gracility of ankle, may be left for a forbearing public to
decide.</p>

</figure>

<p>Her hair is dark—and who so ungallant as to suggest
that its hue is due to artificial causes? Granted that a
powder does exist called Kna; let it freely be admitted that
the fair Serbs often show themselves as desirous as the
ladies of the harem to acquire those raven tresses which
the Koràn distinguishes as a sign of comeliness and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
strength. But a glance—a scintillation—from those eyes
would annihilate any detractor so mean as to bring such
imputations against our Bosniac beauty! Here at once, so
to speak, we are on <i>terra firma</i>. These at least are incapable
of assuming an un-genuine hue; and they are <i>black</i>,—black
as the sloes with which the national poets delight
to compare their mistresses’ orbs, and haloed round with
such dark lashes and eyebrows as the same Serbian imagination
fondly likens to ‘leeches from the fountain.’ But
she was rather the exception in the crowd, and the evident
esteem in which her good looks were held was probably
more due to this accident of hue than anything else; for
if at times the tresses of her artless village rivals <i>happened</i>
on the fashionable colour, their eyes were oftener of a
traitorous turquoise than of jet; and as to the little
children, their hair was of a tell-tale flaxen! Nay, it is to
be feared that if our damsel was on the look out for a
black-eyed sweetheart to match her, she would find some
difficulty in realizing her hopes, since the men’s eyes
were generally of greys or watery blues, and their lanky
locks took an unfortunately reddish hue of brown; and
even supposing her pockets to have been as full of gold,
she was likely to fall as far short of her ideal as the
maiden of Serbian poetry, who sings:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span></p>

<p>The women looked as a rule pleasanter than the
men, whose general appearance, as may perhaps be
gathered from the illustration, is anything but prepossessing.
The whole crown is shorn of hair, Turkish
fashion, but usually, instead of the single pig-tail of the
faithful, two long elf-locks are left dangling from the
back of the head, and the effect of the bare occiput with
these two sickly appendages is little short of disgusting;
add to which that the natural length of the neck is exaggerated
by this tonsure. From the front the aspect
is not more pleasing; the bald pate, combined with the
bony attenuated face and round eyebrows, being often in
a ghastly manner suggestive of a death’s-head. The long
sunken eye-slits, whose outer corners curve down, so as to
follow the lines of the brow-arches, give them an air of
sleepy cunning, the eyebrows often overhanging as to
form a den for the suspicious roving eyes. The lips are
thick, broad, and pouting. The whole face seems dazed,
and it is almost beyond mortal patience to see the heavy,
slow, owlish way in which their head turns on its axis if
anything attracts their attention. When you look at them
they always seem as if they do not know what expression
is expected of them, and their stolidity is enhanced by
turbans which make them look top-heavy. It is easy to
understand why the quick-witted Greeks of the lower
Empire should have nick-named the Sclaves Chondrokephaloi,
or ‘block-heads.’</p>

<p>Yet, after all, the hideous tonsure and what is vilest
in their demeanour are but accidental badges of servitude
and oppression—removable by a few generations of free
government. The sluggishness of their deliberation may
be quickened by culture; and, the causes of suspicion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
once removed, the hang-dog look of the Bosniac would
disappear as surely as it has ceased among the free Serbians,
and as it is disappearing at this day among the
liberated Wallachian serfs. The slow, measured utterance
of the race, so far from being a proof of inferiority, has
been compared by Ami Boué to that of Englishmen,
and this keen observer of the Serbs speaks of the people
and language as born, if any ever were, for parliamentary
government.</p>

<p>The frame of these Bosniac countrymen lacks the
elegance and suppleness of the modern Greek, but it is
stronger and of larger mould. No stranger who passes
through Bosnia can fail to be struck at the exceeding
stature of the inhabitants. The fair here is thronged
with men six feet high, and over. An English traveller
who passed through this country in 1634, and stayed a
day or two in ‘Saraih,’ ‘the metropolis of the kingdome
of Bosnah,’ says, ‘the most notable things I found was
the goodnesse of the water, and vaste, almost <i>gyant-like</i>
stature of the men, which with their bordring upon
<i>Germany</i>, made mee suppose them to be the offspring of
those old <i>Germans</i> noted by <i>Cæsar</i> and <i>Tacitus</i> for their
huge size, which in other places is now degenerate into
the ordinary proportions of men.’<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> Gaunt they may be,
lean and overgrown; but they are sons of Anak; and
though they may now seem a cowering rabble, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
example of their self-liberated brothers in Montenegro
and free Serbia should teach the world that in happier
circumstances they too might hold up their heads and display
the spirit of heroes. Even in their features, in their
broad benevolent forehead and aquiline nose, are disguised
the lineaments of grandeur and manly beauty. Despite
the ill-favour of their expression, there was generally a
lurking geniality to be detected in it, and when among
themselves I was struck with their kindly manners and
good-fellowship; indeed I suspect that it is generally the
stranger’s own fault—probably his want of tact in posing
before them as the friend of the Turk—if they do not
show themselves friendly to him, and relapse into a
bearish reserve. And though the Bosniacs are much
accused of that common failing of the Southern Sclaves,
intoxication, yet it must be said to their credit that in
this large gathering—so large that hardly a spot of standing
ground was left unoccupied in the whole mountain
neck—we did not notice a single case of drunkenness,
and this though there were plenty of booths in the fair
for the sale of arrack and Slavonian wine. Indeed the
general orderliness, the absence of license of any sort,
among the Christian part of the assembly, was beyond all
praise.</p>

<p>As to the fair the display of wares was poor enough,
there being little exposed for sale beyond the usual
crockery, and the cheapest and most gimcrack jewelry,
brass rings, and brooches of the very worst Bosniac fabric,
and here and there a little fruit—water-melons, and small
plums and pears. The only articles worth mentioning
were the square, elegantly chipped gun-flints, of a kind
which is to be found in all Bosnian markets. These are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
knapped at Avlona, in Albania, near the old Acroceraunian
promontory, from about which the flints are
gathered; and they are interesting, as being probably the
most perfect representatives in modern Europe of an art
which was once the highest among mankind. Our Norfolk
flint-knappers, who still export this old-world article of
commerce to the savages of Africa, could never compete
with the artists who turn out
these <i>chefs-d’œuvre</i> of delicate
flaking!</p>

</figure>

<p>About 1 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> we started on
our mountain-crossing expedition
towards Travnik; first descending
from our altitude towards the
Franciscan monastery of Comušina,
which we found to consist
of an unpretending house and a
bare, pewless church standing in
the middle of a wretched little
village. The door of the monastery
was fastened, and a woman who parleyed with us
from an upper window said that all the ‘brothers’ were
up at the shrine. On our way we had passed through the
Christian cemetery—a wilderness so deep in bracken that
it seemed to have been purposely left to the charitable
clothing of Nature, as if they feared that even their graves,
if seen, might be insulted by the passing Zaptieh. The
memorials here were rude stones, sometimes scarcely
touched by art, sometimes rudely graven with a Latin
cross like one of the ‘Hadjuks’ graves’ already described.
But we groped among the fern-leaves in vain for an inscription.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span></p>

<p>Beyond this we descended by a path to the Ussora,
and finding that our attendant Zaptieh’s scansorial powers
were small, and that, not having on his shoulders a heavy
knapsack like ourselves, he was yet inclined to lag hopelessly,
there was nothing for it but to dismiss him, after
first inditing under a walnut-tree beside the waters of
Ussora a letter in our choicest French to the Kaïmakàm,
in which we gave our escort a good character, only expressing
our regret that his inability to climb mountains
<i>à l’Anglaise</i> deprived us of the further pleasure of his
company. We afterwards had reason to regret that
besides the backshish or largess which was his due we
gave him too large a proportion of our remaining store of
bread, not sufficiently realising the slow progress which we
should make between this and Travnik.</p>

<p>We now followed the river bed, every now and then
wading from one side to the other of the shallow stream
in a vain search for a forest-path which should lead in the
right direction. We found Major Roskiević’s<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> map so
completely out, that we really suspected that he had been
the victim of the Vila’s enchantments—and who, conversant
with the history of the building of Scodra, does not
know that it is her practice to thwart engineers who presumptuously
invade her precincts? And I would urge in
proof of this hypothesis that her sacred mount, the Vila
Gora of the peasants hereabouts, under whose brows we
are now passing, is conspicuous by its absence on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
Major’s chart. Before we had concluded our itinerary of
Bosnia we had further proofs that the Vila or some other
freakish sprite had possessed that unfortunate officer.
Often has the Major played the part of a will-o’-the-wisp
for our especial misguidance! At times he would display
such extraordinary capacities of faith as to remove mountains.
He would evolve streams which existed not, out
of his inner consciousness, and when he conceived that
this pleasantry had gone far enough he would swallow
them up in the earth. He would transport villages bodily.
He would run a broad valley through a mountain mass
from which Xerxes would have recoiled, and bridge over
chasms at which Stephenson would have shuddered. Not
that his humour is always of this ponderous turn; oh
no! he has his lighter veins, too, in which he will draw
you a zigzagging road straight as a line, or pop the
only path on the wrong side of the stream!</p>

<p>At about 5 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> we found ourselves at the junction
of the Ziraja and the Blatnica, as we learnt from some
peasants—<i>for they never meet</i> according to the Major.
The peasants, who were dressed in the heavily ornamented
quasi-Dalmatian costume of these mountains, and were of
the type which it has pleased me to call Hunnish, were
much delighted at a present of English needles from the
‘consuls.’</p>

<p>We now began ascending the Troghìr Planina by a
faintly indicated woodman’s path, overshadowed by a
beech-forest of finer growth than any we had yet seen,
interspersed with equally majestic pines. Amongst these
mysterious labyrinths we lost our path, and coming
towards dusk on an inviting glade commanding a lovely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
mountain panorama, pitched on it as our place of bivouac
for the night. Here we found no difficulty in collecting
firewood for a cheery fire, and bracken enough to form a
springy mattress; and having cooked our frugal supper,
we submitted to be lulled to sleep by the chorus of
tree-crickets above. The night was again fine; so that,
except for the cold, which in the small hours of the
morning was bitter—as it generally is when the camp
fire has burnt down beyond recovery!—we passed a
fairly comfortable night, till we were aroused by the
droning of gnats in our ears, and were again on our
way, before the sun.</p>

<p>But now we began to be beset by a difficulty which
while in the forest zone of the mountains we had not
anticipated—namely, the absence of water, caused by the
porous character of the limestone rock; and though we
succeeded in finding our path again, all the runnels we
passed were dried by summer drought. The woods were
very silent, and there was no morning song of birds beyond
the cooing of a dove; but while we were resting we heard
a deep musical hum among the tree-tops, proceeding from
myriads of gnats, some of which were droning below. We
kept gradually ascending the back of the Planina, our path
continually disappearing or losing itself in a maze of lesser
tracks, which might have been made as much by animals
as by man; and every now and then we had to scramble on
as best we could over tree-trunks of monstrous girth that
barred our path. But still no water to make breakfast
palatable! till about two hours after starting we came to
a stagnant pool or puddle about the size of an ordinary
washing-basin, which, as necessity knows no law, we were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
driven to make use of, and to pick the tadpoles out of our
tea as best we might!</p>

<p>But how describe this forest scenery! how paint, so
that others may see as we saw them, the golden rays of
the rising sun slanting between the leafy tiers of the
beeches, intersecting their shady trunks with pillars of
light, shimmering beyond against the dark mountain flank;
not dappling it in round noon-day patches, but streaking
it horizontally with golden ripples, comparable to nothing
but mackerel clouds glorified by the sunset, trailing across
some darker tract of sky. Now and then the mighty
trunks and branches frame vistas of mountain and valley,
flooded still by a forest sea unflecked by habitation—an
enamel of quiet blue. Then the luminous foliage of the
beeches gives place for a while to more sombre pines,
whose turpentiny fragrance floats like morning incense
down the forest aisles. Hour after hour, as we ascend, the
forest still looms around us, but the scenery is perpetually
changing.</p>

<p>At one point we reached a mountain bluff more open
to the wind, and found ourselves in a clearing not made
by man. From the rocky summit an awful scene of ruin
burst upon us. That soft blue heaven—azure and cloudless
as a tranquil sea—it, too, has its storms and windy Scyllas
to play havoc among these aërial masts. This was one
universal wreck—the wreck of an Armada. Far and wide
every tree had been struck down like Canaanitic walls.
The very current of the tornado was marked by the lie of
the prostrate trunks. At times a confused medley—piles
of scarce distinguishable spars and giant hulks—jumbled
together as if they had been nine-pins!—showed the eddy
of a whirlwind; but generally the trunks were strewn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
pointing from the north-east like so many magnets: one
vast torrent track of destruction marking the course of the
<i>Bora</i>, the irresistible storm-wind of Illyria. In places we
have found the periodic
force of this wind utilized
by the Bosniacs, who cut
the trees a quarter through
on the leeward side and
leave the rest to the woodcraft
of Boreas.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus30.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Tree struck by Lightning.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But once more we
plunge into the primeval
shadows to find ourselves
among more isolated monuments
of ruin. Here it is
the artillery of heaven that
has been playing on the
masted swell of the green
Planina. Now we have
reached the very focus of
an electric storm. The
trunks of beech and fir
sometimes riven asunder,
more generally erect but decapitated, stripped of bark and
branches; sometimes shattered columns charred by the
aërial explosion, sometimes splintered up into trophies of
white spears. Here is one of the most striking witnesses
to the stupendous power of lightning that I have ever
seen. A beech about eighty feet in height was snapped
in two, the upper part hurled on to the slope below, the
lower still rooted to the ground, but the hard wood
splashed by the thunderer’s bolt—as when a bomb-shell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
strikes the sea—into gigantic splinters: keen, shapely
blades, as much as twenty feet in length.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a></p>

<p>Then, again, we passed through a region of pines,
grim, time-stained—scarred and bereft of limbs in many
a battle with the elements—with bare long arms and
patriarchal beards of hoary lichen; an older generation of
trees, waiting in vain for kindly axe or levelling blast;
and awakening, in their Arctic desolation, memories of a
Lapland forest-scene. And now once more a charming
transformation takes place. Cheerful beech avenues again
overarch us, or open out in sunny glades, where butterflies—commas,
whites, clouded yellows—are fluttering
and settling about yellow salvias and a flower which looked
like a rosy phlox with a single blossom. Now we found,
to our great relief, an icy-cold stream, and prepared our
noon-day repast in a beechwood glen that carried us back
to the chalk hills of old England. Here we recognized
around us those old familiar ferns, the prickly and the
maiden-hair<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>—polypody, flouncing the old stumps with
charitable raiment—rarer tufts of blechnum; and, prying
curiously among the beech-roots for another of our chalk-hill
favourites, we found—sure enough!—that spiky shell<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a>
which seems to imitate the form and colour of the sheathed
buds of the beech-leaves.</p>

<p>The track we now followed began to descend rapidly,
and we discovered, after climbing down a considerable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
way, that we were on the wrong side of the watershed, so
that there was nothing for it but to reascend as nearly
as possible two thousand feet towards the main ridge of
Troghìr which we had left.</p>

<p>A comparatively bare steep tempted us to make
straight for our object; but having with difficulty fought
our way upwards through a jungle of fern and dwarf elder,
we presently found ourselves entangled among the <i>débris</i>
of a not very ancient forest fire. The ground was toothed
with sharp splinters of burnt rock, and strewn with a network
of branches, too rotten to bear our weight, but quite
strong enough to trap our feet and tumble us over—all
which gins and snares were treacherously concealed by a
forest of bracken which rose above our heads. Add to
this, that at every few yards we had to scale high barricades
of sooty timber, and at the time were at a loss to conceive
why Providence should have made fir-trees so confoundedly
spiky! When it is remembered that we had about five-and-twenty
pounds on our backs, and that the sun was
broiling hot, it may be imagined that our progress was slow,
and in fact we were forced to win every inch as much
with our hands as our feet. However, as we gradually
stormed our citadel, we were rewarded for our bumps
and lacerations by a view as strange as it was picturesque.
In these upper regions it was only the smaller trees that
had been actually burnt down, the larger had been simply
killed and left standing. The sight as we looked down
had a savage fascination quite unique; the colours were so
varied, so striking, so bizarre, that they deserved to have
been perpetuated by a great painter. Here and there
were the charred funereal skeletons of forest giants, with
jagged stumps of branches in harsh relief against a distant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
background of green valley and blue undulating mountain,
almost voluptuous in its softness of tint and contour. In
some trunks the blackness was chequered, where the bark
had peeled off, by broad scars, taking every tint of amber;
in others, it was draped in ashy festoons of lichen, or
swathed in verdant folds of moss. Some trees, already
roasted to death by fire, had at a later period been shivered
by the lightning, and the whiteness of their splinters
showed that little but their bark had been charred by the
previous conflagration. Some indeed had actually survived
it, and on one side a small island of still flourishing trees—a
dark yew-green fir, an emerald and a golden beech—stood
out against the sootiest thicket.</p>

<p>But we gradually left this funereal waste beneath us,
and groping upwards once more through virgin forest, at
last succeeded in regaining the ridge of Troghìr. We
even hit on our lost path, but it soon eluded us again and
disappeared beneath the wrecks of tall pine-trees, which
seemed to have buried all traces of it. For here, if a fallen
tree bars the path, the Bosniac woodman does not cut it
away, but either climbs over it, or, if the obstacle is too
high for man or beast to surmount, he deserts the track
altogether and makes another elsewhere. Thus the forest
barricades are gradually allowed to accumulate till they
reach dimensions simply stupendous, and the path which
originally swerved a few yards out of its course may
eventually be turned as much as a mile. But we had
learnt a lesson about trusting to paths which, while still
smarting from the effects of our second ascent of Troghìr,
we were not likely to neglect; so this time we followed
the guidance of our compass as literally as we could, scaling
barrier after barrier till we were well nigh worn out.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
No one, I think, who has not himself tried to penetrate a
primeval forest on a windy mountain ridge, can realize
what these obstacles really are! It was late in the afternoon
when we conquered our last barricade, and to our
delight beheld before us the smooth lawny swell which
forms the summit of the Vučia Planina, from which the
Troghìr is an offshoot.</p>

<p>An easy ascent brought us to the top, where we rested
awhile to enjoy the glorious mountain panorama that
opened out all round. We are now in the very heart of
Alpine Bosnia, ‘each one of whose lofty mountains,’ to
quote the words of her native historian,<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> ‘exalted to Ayuk,
the fiery star, is an eyesore to the foe.’ But the traveller
must make allowance for Oriental hyperbole. Here, at
least, the mountains were contented with a less sidereal
stature; nor was there much that could even be called
rocky or precipitous except the head of Vlašić to the
south, which peered over lower mountain shoulders and
conical peaks, shrouded, as the long neck of Troghìr below
us, as all the other Goras and Planinas round, with dense
forest growth. To call the scenery Swiss would be mere
flattery; indeed, its whole character, the small height of
the mountains, the want of boldness, the down-like swell
of their contours, recalls rather the Carpathians than any
part of the Alps that I have seen. The summit of Vučia,
on which we now are, is inconsiderable as regards altitude,
not being more than 4,300 feet, according to our aneroid,
though, to be sure, the Major makes it 5,000—for the sake
of round numbers. There is something Carpathian, too,
about the forests, the gigantic pines and beeches, and—as
might be expected from the commonly calcareous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
nature of the soil—in the flora generally. Here, as in the
ranges that border Roumania, the drooping gentian, the
sweet-william, and the sunflower are among the most
noticeable flowers.</p>

<p>But the sun is sinking low in the heavens, and it is
high time for us to be again on our legs. We now made
our way across the southern slopes of the summit, or rather
table-land, of Vučia, which forms a lovely Alp or mountain
pasture. At intervals we came upon peasants of the type
we had seen the evening before (we had met with no
human being in the intervening day) tending kine, or
mowing hay. When, however, we approached some
women—who, being unveiled, we assumed to be Latin
Christians—to ask the bearings of Travnik, they rushed
away into a thicket screeching, ‘<i>Hai ’ti! hai ’ti!</i>’ ‘Off!
off!’ so Moslemized—if indeed they were rayahs, as we
think certain—were their ideas of propriety! One of
them had made a sign which we mistook for an answer
to our enquiry, and against our better judgment we followed
the direction indicated, and which afterwards
turned out to be hopelessly wrong.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, our lines had fallen in pleasant places.
The fresh scent of hay was delicious; the soft undulating
mountain lawn, dotted with magnificent beeches, kept
perpetually recalling a fine English park; on one side, too,
it was appropriately fringed by a fir-plantation of Nature.
It was quite hard to realize that we were far from any
town or even shelter. In the midst of these loneliest of
mountains one kept half expecting to catch sight of the
cosy red gables and mullioned windows of some old Elizabethan
mansion. The beeches seemed to have caught
the inspiration of the landscape. In the freer atmosphere<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
of these glades they had lost the almost poplar-like procerity
of their forest-growth, and expanded into that more
pear-shaped outline which is so congenial to genteel precincts.
Over those forest depths through which we had
been diving all the day had reigned the ‘silence of the
central sea,’ but these woodland coasts and islands were
alive with garden songsters—tits and wrens and blackbirds—fluttering
about in the golden sunshine of evening,
and filling our ears with familiar home melodies.</p>

<p>Here, too, we saw a most beautiful sight—a fine
convolvulus hawk-moth (we had made acquaintance with
another the evening before), up and dissipating at an
hour when all well-regulated moths should be wrapped
in downy slumbers, and making, as we thought, a most
unfair use of a proboscis full two inches long to drain the
nectar from a whole spike of yellow salvia, before any of
its fellows should be awake to cry halves. It was a
pert fly, and seemed quite to revel in the sunlight—a
‘<i>fast</i>’ trait, it is to be feared in a nocturnal insect. Such
airs, too, as it gave itself!—flouting here, flirting there;
flitting on from conquest to conquest. As if the gorgeous
creature did not know that it was irresistible! As if the
very sunbeams did not lackey it—showering gold-dust
over that expanse of delicately-mottled grey! What
Danae sprite, never so pent up in perfumed cell, could
resist such courtship? What flowery elf be proof against
the superb obeisance of that taper body, tricked out in
all its tiger livery of rose and sable? To see it dawdle
round a bevy of fair blossoms, in lazy eddies, drifting
rather than flying, with a <i>blasé</i> air of languid inspection;
to see it, in more light fantastic vein, dance off to the
flower of its capricious choice, and bob airily up and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
down, coquetting with those saffron lips, ere it poised—how
daintily!—to steal their sweetness. It was decidedly
livelier than our friend of yestereen, and so intent upon
its nectar as to let us gaze within a foot of it; it seemed
to have a keener, a more epicurean, enjoyment of life,
and gave itself all the airs of a <i>bon-vivant</i>. Indeed it
showed its good taste in its preference for salvia; for the
scent of these flowers is exquisite, and I have sometimes
stopped wonderingly to look for musk, so like is the
smell at a little distance off.</p>

<p>On this side of the mountains the flowers and foliage
are more luxuriant. Glade and woodland are sprinkled
with kinds we have not yet met with, a large rosy cranesbill,
a yellow labiate, with a peak of the most gorgeous
purple leaves—if indeed they were not petals—tremulous
little hare-bells, <i>lastræa</i> and delicate varieties of ferns,
while here and there bright scarlet strawberries gemmed
the ground. The trees grow to an even more gigantic
stature than those we saw before. We measured beeches
fifteen feet in circumference, at about three feet from
the ground; and many—as on the Mazulia Planina
opposite, where some of the finest timber in Bosnia is
said to grow—rise to a height of a hundred and twenty
feet. A pine-tree measured fourteen feet and a half
in girth.</p>

<p>For we are again immersed in the primeval forest—and
night seems nearer and shelter further. The sun
was already setting, when a gap in the trees revealed to
us a mountain vista, which showed that we were on the
wrong side of the ridge. A woodman whom we presently
met told us that we were going towards Zenica instead
of Travnik, and we discovered that we were on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
debatable mountain neck, between the Vučia and Gorcevica
Planinas. The woodman intimated to us that to
strike across and attempt to regain the Travnik path was
hopeless, and that we had better follow the ridge in the
direction of Zenica. But we made up our minds to cut
across and follow the valley of a stream which led in our
direction. Accordingly we crossed over to the western
side of our ridge, and found ourselves on the brink of an
almost precipitous steep, descending to the Jasenica, our
desired stream, heard but not seen, thirteen hundred feet
below.</p>

<p>The mean angle at which this slope descended was,
as nearly as we could calculate, 60°. Had it been bare,
we could not possibly have descended it, laden as we
were; but it was covered with beech-trees, which might
stop us if we fell; so we resolved to attempt a descent.</p>

<p>It was certainly very difficult work; the beech-leaves
made it slippery, and concealed rocks and boughs would
trip us up, or a piece of soil give way. We were perpetually
dislodging fragments of rock, which rolled and
leapt down, quicker and quicker, crash after crash, cannoning
against the trunks, taking bigger and bigger
bounds, till a final plunge told us that they had reached
the stream. They never lodged half way. Every now
and then we seemed likely to follow them, but we
always succeeded in arresting our fall by clutching at a
passing trunk. It grew darker and darker; but we
still kept on at our painful task, till, about six hundred
feet down, I broke one of my knapsack straps in a tumble,
and it being impossible in such a position either
to mend it or to carry it, we were lucky in discovering,
close by, a hollow—formed by the uprooting of a forest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
giant—to serve as sleeping-quarters for our third night
running, <i>sub Jove frigido</i>, and where we literally <i>lodged</i>
till peep-o’-day. The worst was that we were unable to
collect fuel for a fire, and before morning a chill breeze
sprang up, and the thermometer sank almost to freezing
point; for, in less mountainous localities than this, August
frosts are by no means rare in Bosnia. For nocturnal
visitors we might take our choice—as the wind invented
footsteps—of the wild swine, bears, and wolves, that inhabit
these mountains; but none of these fourfooted gentry
molested us; and, except that once or twice we woke with
the cold, or by reason of sundry stones and awkward tags
of root, which would keep running into us, we slept
soundly enough.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 17.</i>—Having executed the needful repairs, we
continued our descent before sunrise, and finally found
ourselves at the bottom of the gorge—the opposite steep
of Mazulia frowning over us as precipitously as that
which we had descended, and the whole ravine being so
narrow that there was room for nothing but the Jasenica
torrent below, over arched by the stupendous beeches
which clung to both steeps.</p>

<p>In a dry part of its bed we demolished our last scrap
of bread, and reviewed our position, which was not
favourable. The gorge in which we found ourselves was
from all points so inaccessible that we doubted whether it
had ever been trodden by foot of man before. To make
our way along the valley seemed well nigh impossible, so
vast were the rock and timber barricades with which the
torrent had piled its course. On the other hand, to reascend
either steep was tantamount to a defeat, and in
either case would bring us no forwarder. But it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
becoming painfully evident that we must get somewhere,
and quickly—as the day before, owing to our ill-judged
liberality to our Zaptieh, we had had to stint ourselves of
food, and now the last scrap of solid nutriment was gone—there
could be no doubt about that! So, all things considered,
there was nothing for it but to fight our way down
the gorge as best we might, and trust that as the stream
got lower its valley would widen. We found that the
best way was to plunge bodily through the water, now
and then jumping from rock to rock, or slipping into deep
pools, and every few yards having to scale dams of trunks
and branches, whose hugeness showed the force of the
torrent in the rainy season. The want of an axe made
a good deal of this work more difficult than it otherwise
would have been, so that it sometimes took an hour to
make a few score yards of way.</p>

<p>And yet the guerdon of our struggle was rich indeed.
An hour or so from our starting-point the sides of our
ravine became more rocky, and started up sheerly on
either side of the stream, which, dashing between these
‘iron gates,’ leapt from a rocky platform, and plunged
some sixty feet below in a magnificent cascade. We were
forced to make a tedious détour by climbing up the
steep; but the rocky walls, the overhanging beeches,
the snow-white foam veiling the abysmal gloom, gave us
glimpses of a beautiful picture. The vegetation, too, of
our valley was marvellous in its luxuriance. Here, where
the rays of the meridian sun scarcely pierce, stately sunflowers
would raise their great flaming crowns as if to
light up the shades of fell and forest. Drooping gentians—those
weeping willows among flowers!—hung lovingly over
the stream: methought they were its guardian nymphs,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
swelling its waters with tributary dew from a myriad azure
urns! The dimensions taken by some of the ferns were
certainly extraordinary; the lady-fern waved feather-like
sprays near five feet in length, the hart’s tongue put forth
fronds like small palm-leaves, three feet long and about
three inches broad. Even the tree-like moss<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> that cushioned
the damp crevices
between the rocks
rose to an abnormal
stature.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp48" id="illus31" style="max-width: 20.3125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus31.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Rocky Gorge of the Jasenica.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>After many
weary hours the valley
began to open
out a little, and the
stream allowed us
room for passage on
its margin. Further
on we came to
little patches of meadow
land by its
side, and even, here
and there, to traces
of a path, and another
sign of man,
the ashes of an old
camp-fire. Beyond
this, again, the mountains grew more rocky, the trees
smaller and more scanty, and scenery of a bolder kind
broke upon us. First, as if to prepare us for what was to
follow, a tall obelisk of rock started up in the middle of
the gorge; and having passed, as it were, Cleopatra’s Needle,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
the rock-architecture took an appropriately Egyptian
character, and we found ourselves among what it only
required a slight exercise of imagination to transform into
the ruins of the Pharaohs. Colossal walls and columns
towered on each side of the torrent, and scarcely allowed
it a passage; and, looking through these antique portals,
the top of a pyramid appeared in the distance—the limestone
peak or Vlašić.</p>

<p>We made our way with some difficulty through the
precipitous defile, and were rewarded by a cheerful prospect
of a maize-covered height beyond, surmounted by
wooden huts and the minaret of a mosque. A short climb
brought us to the village, called Zagredzi, hanging on the
slope of Mt. Mazulia. Here we thought to get something
to eat, for we were half famished; but we certainly
were not prepared for the inhospitality of the villagers,
who apparently were all Mahometans. As we passed
along the street every door was slammed. The women
scurried away and hid themselves; even the men fled at
our approach; and though we succeeded so far as to parley
with one, no entreaties or offers of money could induce
him to procure us bread or milk. So there was nothing
for it but to proceed on our way and shake the dust of
this churlish village from our feet. Just outside we passed
what we take to have been an old <i>karaula</i> or watch-tower,
of rough masonry, square in shape, with barred windows
and an old circular arch now half buried in the ground,
surmounted by a plain round moulding. Happily, beyond
this we came upon an apple-tree, and, as the ground was
strewn with apples, considered ourselves justified in anticipating
the vagrant swine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span></p>

<p>We presently met a party of countrymen, and persuaded
one, in return for coin of the realm, to put us into
the way to the village of Podove, there to strike the path
for the Franciscan monastery of Gučiagora, where we purposed
to throw ourselves on monkish hospitality. At
Podove we found for the first time some monuments of
a kind which we were to meet with again in other parts
of Bosnia, and which are scattered over the whole
country.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus32" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus32.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Mysterious Sepulchres, Podove.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These are large tombstones, some as much as six feet
long by three in height, of a tea-caddy shape, resting on
a broader stone platform. The impression they give you
is that they are descendants of Roman sarcophagi, and
indeed their upper part is exactly similar to some Roman
monuments.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> There is, so far as I have seen, no inscription
on them; but occasionally, as on some of those at
Podove, they are ornamented with incised arches at the
end and side of a quasi-Gothic form, which may be useful
in determining their date. The erosion of the stone and
mutilated condition of many probably point to considerable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
antiquity, as also does the fact that I have
twice noticed them overturned and blocking up the
channel of streams which had undermined their original
standing ground. They certainly bear no resemblance
to the turbaned columns of Turkish cemeteries, and
indeed an examination of those at Podove convinced
me that many had been purposely mutilated by the unbeliever.</p>

<p>All these facts point to the conclusion that they are,
as the Bosniacs express it when they want to indicate a
date previous to the Turkish captivity, ‘more than three
hundred years old.’ On the other hand, if not Moslem,
neither are they like the memorial stone crosses, such as
one we were shortly to see at Gučiagora, which are the
undoubted work of Christians, and which date back at
least to the sixteenth century.</p>

<p>There are, however, some modern monuments which
we noticed at one place in the Herzegovina which resemble
these in outline; these were in a small Jewish graveyard
outside Mostar, and had Hebrew inscriptions on them.
But the Jews of Bosnia and the Herzegovina are all a
Spanish-speaking people, who took refuge from their Christian
oppressors within the borders of more tolerant Islâm
in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. Previous to this
settlement there do not seem to have been any Jews in
the country, since in early Bosnian history, so occupied with
religious struggles, so blood-stained with fanaticism, there
is not, so far as I am aware, any mention of them. Even
at the present day they are, as regards numbers, an insignificant
minority, domiciled almost exclusively in a few
of the larger towns.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> It is hardly conceivable, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
that in early times the Hebrews should have occupied the
country to such an extent as to have dotted it with these
monuments, which are to be found <i>passim</i> throughout
Bosnia. On the other hand, the stones that we saw near
Mostar were considerably smaller than these ancient
examples; and it seems quite possible that the Jews, with
their national thriftiness, should have simply used some of
these old blocks which they found ready to hand, cutting
off the time-worn exterior or exposing a new surface
for their inscriptions, but for convenience sake retaining
the original form. Whatever the explanation of these
Mostar monuments, I feel constrained to give up the
hypothesis that these older memorials are of Jewish workmanship.</p>

<p>But to whom, then, are these mysterious blocks to be
referred? A better key to the solution of their origin
and date is to be obtained by comparing them with some
monuments of more finished execution and greater fecundity
of ornament described by Sir Gardner Wilkinson,<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a>
as existing near Imoschi and at other places on the Dalmatian
frontier. These, although not exactly answering
to the ruder handiwork of the Bosnian midlands, are yet
so evidently allied, that what is true of them must to a
great extent be true of these before us. On the blocks
described by Sir Gardner there occur devices such as
huntsmen with bows and spears, knight’s holding sword
and shield, and even occasionally rude armorial bearings,
all which fix the date of their execution between the
twelfth and sixteenth centuries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span></p>

<p>There were other peculiarities about ‘these unknown
sepulchres,’ as Sir Gardner calls even the more storied
Dalmatian monuments. On many appeared a crescent
moon with star or stars, and on others an arm holding
a sword. Now it is a curious fact that, of these two
devices, one—the moon and star—is the emblem of Illyria
occurring in the middle of the old Bosnian escutcheon;<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a>
the other—the arm of offence—is the ensign of Primorie,
the Serbian coast-land. These sepulchral devices seem,
therefore, to have been badges of nationality or clanship;
unless, indeed, anyone prefers to suspect that the moon
and star possessed a superstitious, before they acquired a
heraldic, import.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p>In the lonely gorge of the Želesnica, to the south-west
of Serajevo, we found one of these lunar monuments,
which I mention here as it further illustrates the
connection between the Bosnian and Dalmatian tombs.
It was a sarcophagus of the same kind as those at
Podove, but with a crescent rudely engraved at one end.
In juxtaposition with this was an upright slab, I can
scarcely call it a cross, about six feet high and much
mutilated.</p>

<p>But there is another point of resemblance even more
important than the half moon, to connect the sepulchres
we saw with those described by Sir Gardner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span></p>

<p>Out of a large number of these Bosnian monuments
which we examined here and elsewhere, there was not one
on which we could detect the remotest semblance of a
cross. Sir Gardner Wilkinson notices, with reference to
the Dalmatian tombs, that ‘it is singular that the cross
should occur so rarely,’ and supposes that those few
monuments on which he found it belong to a later
date, when, owing to the Turkish conquests, there was
more reason to introduce the distinguishing emblem of
Christianity. For my part I cannot think this account
satisfactory; but it seems to me that an explanation
lies at hand which will make the absence of the
cross on these monuments at once intelligible, and may
serve as a clue towards unravelling the mystery of their
origin.</p>

</figure>

<p>The Bogomiles—that strange Manichæan sect whose
history has already been touched on, and who appear to
have formed the majority of the Bosnian population during
the very centuries in which these monuments were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
erected—shrank with horror from representations of the
cross. ‘They abhor the cross as the instrument of Christ’s
death,’ says Euthymius,<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> who, from having been commissioned
by the Emperor to extract the full tenets of the
sect out of its ‘heresiarch’ Basil, is peculiarly qualified to
speak on the matter. When pressed by Euthymius as to
the reason why the Bogomiles, when vexed with devils,
ran to the cross and cried out to it, he made answer that
the evil spirits within them loved the cross, for it was their
own handiwork. It appeased them, therefore, or enticed
them forth. Is not, then, the absence of the cross on
these monuments, coupled with the fact of its presence on
all undoubtedly <i>orthodox</i> sepulchres throughout these
regions, and some of these of considerable antiquity, strong
presumptive evidence that they are the work of those old
Bosnian puritans?</p>

<p>This reasoning will perhaps appear the more significant
when it is added that the modern Bosniacs refer these
hoary sepulchres to the Bogomiles.</p>

<p>Thus the voice of tradition, the remarkable conformity
of these tombs with a salient peculiarity of the
Bogomilian religion, the approximate date of their erection—all
point to the same conclusion. Add to these
the locality of so many of these ancient graveyards.
During the course of our journey through Bosnia we
came upon many spots where these interesting monuments
existed. They were generally away from towns—in
mountain gorges, by unfrequented paths—in the
Wilderness, in short, where the Bogomiles took refuge<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
from their Romish oppressors. The secluded position of
these tombs recalls the words of Raphael of Volaterra,
who speaks of the Manichæan brotherhoods as living in
hidden valleys among the mountains of Bosnia.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> It
has already been noticed that the peculiar situation of
these sectaries, perhaps too their iconoclastic tenets,
made them ready to welcome Mahometan in place of
Romish rulers, and favoured that process of renegation
which has given us a Sclavonic race of believers in the
Prophet. May not this account for the preservation of
so many of these monuments, when nearly every other
præ-Turkish memorial of Bosnia has been swept away?
Is it not conceivable that these renegade Manichees may
still have looked with peculiar tenderness on the tombs
of their fathers, and have averted the hand of the
destroyer? Alas! neither heretic nor infidel has a <i>vates
sacer</i> to enlighten us on these sepulchral mysteries; but
we at least found it pleasing to believe that the rudely
hewn blocks, that we came upon amid primeval forest or
solitary mountain glen, were, as the Bosniacs assert, ‘the
tombs of the Bogomiles’—the sole material memorials of
those staunch upholders of Puritan faith in the days of
grosser superstition, whose sweet spiritual influences every
reformed church in the world feels still, though it may not
acknowledge!</p>

<p>We now crossed the river Bila, into which the Jasenica
had debouched, and, ascending the hills to the south-west,
presently came in sight of the lately erected Franciscan
monastery of Gučiagora—a large white barrack-like pile
with a bulbous church tower, situate at the hollow of
the hill, at an altitude of 2,300 feet above the sea, according<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
to our reckoning. On a hillock just outside was a
curious Christian monument, of evidently considerable
antiquity. On one side was a foliated cross of some
merit; on the other a Latin cross, showing that it was
the work of Roman Catholics, as indeed one would expect
from the denomination of the present inhabitants of this
neighbourhood. But it belonged to a period when the
Illyrian church did not disdain to make use of the
national Serbian alphabet, for it presented an inscription,
the Cyrillian characters of which the present monks of
Gučiagora were unable to decipher.</p>

<p>Making our way through the entrance arch of the
monastery, much as if we were entering an Oxford College,
we found ourselves in a quadrangle with cloisters below.
There a monk came up to us, and bidding us follow
him upstairs, conducted us to the guest-chamber, where
others of the fraternity soon made their appearance, and
received us with right monkish hospitality. They were
not slow in perceiving, from our hungry plight, that we
stood in need of something more substantial than ghostly
comfort; and while some hurried off to their manciple
with orders to provide us speedily with a solid refection,
others revived our drooping spirits for the moment with
native Bosnian wine—fresh from the goat—happily succeeded
by Turkish coffee.</p>

<p>The monks were Minorites, of that order of St. Francis
of Assisi whose services in combating Bosnian heresy of
old have been already recorded.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> They were fourteen,
all told; and certainly, so far as room was concerned, they
had power to add to their numbers, for their church
forms only one side of their quadrangle, the other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
three being intended for occupation; and as there are
three storeys, and each side has thirty-nine windows
looking into the quadrangle, it may be gathered that the
monks are not pinched for room.</p>

<p>The church itself, which completed the quadrangle
in most appropriately collegiate fashion, was a painful
jumble of paint and stucco with wooden pillars, and a
few saintly gimcracks. For musical performances it
possessed a harmonium, and, like that at Comušina, it
was completely devoid of pews.</p>

<p>The monks were unfeignedly astonished at our appearance,
and would hardly believe that we had arrived
on foot and without escort. They said that to travel in
Bosnia at present without Turkish guards was sheer madness;
that the state of the country was becoming more
critical every moment; and that the insurrection in the
Herzegovina had roused Mahometan fanaticism to such a
pitch that all the Christians of the neighbourhood were
seriously dreading a massacre. The monks themselves
certainly seemed to share in the prevailing panic; for the
day before, when the Latins of the district were assembled
at the monastery to celebrate the feast of the Assumption,
the brothers had sent off to the Mutasarìf, the Turkish
governor of Travnik, for protection. The Mutasarìf, recognising,
apparently, the legitimacy of their fears, had sent
them a guard of soldiers, and the Christian congregation
had performed their devotions under the tutelage of
Turkish bayonets.</p>

<p>It may at first sight seem strange that people in fear
of Turkish violence should have had recourse to Turkish
protection, and perhaps stranger still that such protection
should have been accorded them. The explanation, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
fact, lies at the root of much that is least intelligible to
the outsider in the present state of Bosnia.</p>

<p>It has been the policy of the Mahometan conqueror
to favour the Roman Church in the province, as a ready
counterpoise to the orthodox Serbians, who in numbers far
outweigh the Mussulmans,<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> and who, in contradistinction
to the Latins, are imbued with national aspirations. On
the other hand, the Roman ecclesiastics as a rule entertain
a far more wholesome abhorrence of their fellow-Christians
than of the infidel, and so the alliance is compacted
by mutual benefits. The Turks, from the year 1463,
when Sultan Mahomet granted the Franciscan monks
their great Charter of Liberties, the ‘Atname,’<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> have been
politicly liberal to them, exempting their monasteries
and lands from taxation, and freeing the brothers from
the capitation tax which weighs on the rayah. In return,
the monks have exerted their influence in rendering the
Latins submissive to their rulers, and have backed up the
Mahometans in their oppression of the Serbs, as the members
of the Greek Church are significantly called. When
the Latins have been ill used, it has been principally owing
to the weakness of the Osmanlì element and the bigotry
of the Sclavonic renegades of Bosnia, of whose almost independent
rule mention has already been made. When, in
1850, Omer Pashà dealt the death-blow to Mahometan
feudalism here, and practically recovered Bosnia for the
Sultan, he received support from many of the Latins.
At the present moment the danger which the monks were
in such dread of, was not from the Turkish authorities,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>
but from the Sclavonic Mussulmans, the representatives
of the old provincial Janissarism, the descendants of the
Capetans and Begs, who eye the myrmidons of the Stamboul
Government with almost as much hostility as they
do the rayah, and, true to their conservative bigotry, draw
far less subtle distinctions between one Giaour and another.</p>

<p>We were naturally inclined to suppose the fears of
the monks exaggerated, and could not help thinking that
if their situation were as desperate as they would fain
make it out, it would have been better if, instead of praying,
they had taken arms and instructed their flock how
to defy the Moslem in their mountain fastnesses. As for
their lamentations, they smacked of Gildas in their querulousness!
The brothers were especially apprehensive of
a bloody anti-Christian outbreak in Serajevo, the capital
of Bosnia, where they doubted whether the Pashà—himself,
in their opinion, a tolerant man enough—could restrain
the fanaticism of the Mussulman population, which
exceeds that of all other Bosnian Mahometans, as much
as the bigotry of Bosnian Mahometans in general exceeds
that of all the other followers of the Prophet in Turkey-in-Europe.
Of the revolt in the Herzegovina the monks
knew but little, except that Mostar had not fallen.</p>

<p>These alarmist outpourings were relieved by a hospitable
diversion. The brothers conducted us to the refectory—a
spacious chamber, the size of an average college
hall—where we met with most sumptuous entertainment—as
we thought it at the time—consisting of some lumps
of mutton, good brown bread, eggs poached in cheesy
milk, vermicelli, and a sweet melon—a sign that we were
advancing south.</p>

<p>Seated once more in the guest-room, we exchanged<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
ideas with the monks on a variety of interesting topics,
and were much struck with the amount of culture which
many of them possessed. They comprised among them
a respectable acquaintance with modern languages—one
knowing German, another French, another Italian, and
most possessed of at least a smattering of Latin—so that
we were able to hold a most polyglot conversation. The
German-speaking monks told us that they had received
their education at the monastery of Diakovar, in Slavonia.
This was founded in 1857 by the well-known Bishop
Strossmayer, and endowed by the present Emperor of
Austria. It was intended as a theological seminary for
the brothers of the Bosnian order of Minorites, to whom
it was handed over. There is a certain fitness about its
locality, as after the Turkish conquest of Bosnia it was at
Diakovar that her titular bishops fixed their residence;
and it was from there that, for a while, they exercised a
nominal control over their diocese, under Cæsarean influence.
The sheep among wolves, however, very naturally
turned away from absentee shepherds, and sought spiritual,
guidance from the Minorites, who lived in their midst and
shared their vicissitudes. The establishment of this seminary
is therefore a very good move if it was sought to
revive the Imperial influence, for the Franciscan organisation
in Bosnia, on which the whole Latin population depend
for their ghostly needs,<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> is thus placed to a great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
extent under the tutorship of Austria; and if the monks
gain in culture, his Apostolic Majesty gains in goodwill.
Add to this that the Roman Church in Bosnia is in one
way or another indebted to the Imperial Government for
pecuniary contributions, and that the establishment of the
Austrian Consulate-General at Serajevo in 1850 has
made it possible for Austria to play the part of patroness<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>
of the Catholics in Bosnia, and to carry into effect
in the most emphatic way in this part of the Sultan’s
dominions the right of protecting the Roman Catholic
Church in Turkey, which she secured by the Peace of
Carlovitz. No one, after this, will be surprised to learn
that the Roman Catholic influence in Bosnia is a lever in
the hands of Austria; and, to quote the words of an attaché
of the Austrian Consulate-General in Serajevo, ‘The Emperor
of Austria is, in the eyes of Bosnian Roman Catholics,
the Emperor and supreme prince of the Catholic
Church, just as in the eyes of the Oriental Greek population
the Russian Emperor is the head of the Greek Church.’<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>So we were not long in discovering the Austrian leanings
of the monks while discussing the possible eventualities<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
of Bosnia. They were extremely interested in the
attitude of England—complained bitterly of the way in
which we had supported the Turk against the rayah, but
at the same time professed themselves extremely hostile to
Russia. But they betrayed a lively repugnance to the
Great Serbian idea in any shape, seeing in Serbian unity
the triumph of their Greek rivals, who form the large
majority of the population of Bosnia, and who would at
once become the ruling caste,<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> if Bosnia were united to
Free Serbia, Montenegro, and the other fragments of
the old Serbian Empire. As far as we could gather
their aspirations, they were willing to see the old kingship
of Bosnia restored under the suzerainty of Catholic
Austria, thinking that the Latins would thus recover
their old dominant position in the country, and the
Catholic rulers obtain the same support of Austrian cannon
as their forefathers had of Hungarian battleaxes.
Failing the erection of a Roman Catholic principality under
the wing of the double-eagle, they were willing to see the
whole country occupied by Austria, and actually annexed.
But rather than see Bosnia in any form a <i>Serbian</i> state,
they would accept the continuance of Turkish rule.</p>

<p>These sentiments must not however be looked on as
universal among the Roman Catholics of Bosnia. In many
parts they are yielding to a generous sympathy with
Greek fellow-Christians. Notably in Herzegovina, Roman
priests have appeared among the leaders of the insurrection;
and Bishop Strossmayer, whose influence among
the Roman Catholics is very great, is himself a warm
champion of union with free Serbia.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<p>But it is high time to take leave of this hospitable
brotherhood, and continue our way to Travnik, which we
proposed to reach that night. The monks kindly found
us a Latin peasant from the neighbouring village to set us
in the right path, and we began a winding ascent of a
foot of Mt. Vlašić. From the crest of this a fine mountain
prospect opened out to the south and west, range overtopping
range till they culminated in the far distance
towards the Dalmatian frontier. But below we caught
sight of what was then a more welcome prospect, the high-road,
namely, leading to Travnik—it being now four days<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
since we had seen anything which by a stretch of courtesy
could be called a road! Taking leave of our guide, who
was vastly gratified by a couple of ‘grosch,’ as the
Bosniacs call piastres, we made our way to the highway
and followed the telegraph wires—for it was actually lined
with telegraph wires—in the Travnik direction. On one
side of us flowed the little river Lašva, driving a succession
of turbine-mills such as have already been described; and
on the other the limestone heights of Mt. Vlašić rose above
us, bare as regards vegetation, but as we neared the town
planted tier above tier with Turkish gravestones: for
throughout Bosnia—as generally in Turkey—the old-world
fashion prevails of burying the dead by the roadsides
outside the walls of towns. It was an impressive
sight, that forest of turbaned columns. Some loftier headpieces
spoke of the old days of Janissary rule. In places
great stone sarcophagi were overturned and rifled by
the mountain torrent; here and there lay marble slabs
fretted with vine-leaves and interlaced devices, which
still betrayed their Byzantine ancestry. On the left we
passed another landmark of the East—a capacious stone
cistern; and at last a turn in the road revealed to us
the ex-capital of Bosnia—mosques, minarets, and chalet-like
houses harmonizing with the Alpine precipices above;
and, in the midst of the town, a craggy acropolis crowned
with another castle of old Bosnian kings.</p>

<p>We had scarcely entered the town when an observant
Zaptieh pounced upon us to know our business; and on
our demanding to see the Mutasarìf,<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> or Governor, conducted
us to the Konak. The Mutasarìf was at the time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
absent from the town at his country house—at least so
we were informed, though considering the critical state
of the country the statement seemed almost incredible.
We were therefore obliged to show our credentials to his
lieutenant; but this functionary, for some reason, which
the small smattering of Italian of which he was master
failed to convey to us, at once ‘smelt a rat,’ and, as the
best court of inquiry at hand, hurried us off to the telegraph
office, where one of the officials spoke French, and
then and there put us through a severe cross-questioning
as to our route and our objects in travelling.</p>

<p>‘How was it possible,’ he asked, ‘for you to have
arrived at Travnik without escort? You say that you
come from Tešanj over the mountains, but you don’t
expect us to believe that you came on foot! Besides,
where is the <i>pièce de conviction</i>? Where is your Zaptieh?
You say that you are now on the way to Serajevo,
but’—and this was regarded as the most damning
fact of all—‘we see this order in the Vali’s handwriting
was given <i>at</i> Serajevo, and you must therefore be coming
from it; at any rate you must have been there, which
you deny.’</p>

<p>It was a little embarrassing to know how to convince
people who put both postal transmission and pedestrianism
beyond the range of human possibilities! However,
a circumstantial account of our itinerary, coupled
with the awkward fact that they could not deny that our
bujuruldu was in the actual autograph of the Governor-General,
and that, however we came by it, we had it in our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
possession, brought our officials to reason, or at any rate
to a wholesome perception that we were masters of the
situation. So the Mutasarìf’s <i>locum tenens</i> being reduced
to express himself satisfied with our explanation, our
French interrogator changed his tone to one of apology.
He explained that our arrival had been so mysterious that
we seemed to have dropped from the clouds, and our being
on foot and unattended convinced the authorities that we
must be Austrian emissaries sent to excite the Bosnian
rayahs to revolt! ‘You see, monsieur,’ he wound up,
‘you come in very delicate times’—and certainly, to
judge by the un-Turkish bustle of the telegraph office,
the times were ‘delicate’ indeed!</p>

<p>A Zaptieh was now told off to escort us to the ‘best
hotel in Travnik,’ and after a little more stumbling and
slipping through streets so terribly cobbled that they
made one sigh for the mountain-side again, we arrived at
our destination, a miserable <i>han</i>, where we were ushered
into an upper room, and our wants attended to with due
dilatoriness by the squalid <i>hanjia</i> and a boy rejoicing in
the name of ‘Smily,’ who between them made up the
whole personnel of the establishment. Here, while waiting
for the pilaf and indescribables which compose our
evening meal, we have leisure to reflect on the augustness
of the town in which this is considered ‘first class accommodation.’</p>

<p>For Travnik, in the eyes of your Bosniac, is decidedly
no mean city. Although at present, with its 12,000 inhabitants,
only a quarter the size of Serajevo, and indeed
at no period comparable to it either in populousness or
commercial activity, Travnik was yet for nearly two
centuries the political capital of Bosnia, and the seat of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
her Viziers. Their original seat was indeed Serajevo,
but when the Vizierate of Bosnia stretched itself over
Slavonia to the Drave, Banjaluka was fixed on as the city
of residence, owing, it would seem, to the remoteness of
the older capital from the new frontier. But when Buda
was recovered in 1686, Banjaluka might be regarded as
too much at the mercy of a <i>coup de main</i>, and the Divan
of the Vizier was again transferred beyond the watershed
and pitched at Travnik, as if the Turks were still loth to
give up hopes of once more ruling on the Hungarian
bank of the Save. At any rate they kept up the pleasing
fiction that they ruled it still, for down to quite recent
times the Vizier-Pashà who resided here clung to the
vain title ‘Vizier of Hungary.’ The importance of
Travnik is seen in the interesting ‘Account of the War
in Bosnia,’ written in the first half of the last century
by a native Bosnian historian.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> Travnik is the seat of
government and jurisdiction. It is here that a kind of parliament
is ‘summoned by the Vizier, consisting of the magnates,
judges, muftis, priests, and other learned effendis,’
to grant supplies in view of the invasion of Bosnia by the
Austrians. It is outside the walls, on the ‘plains of
Travnik,’ that the army of true believers assembles from
all parts of the province. Serajevo, the seat of the
native aristocracy, became indeed more and more the
real seat of government, but the Sultan’s Lieutenant was
obliged to content himself with his shadowy dignity at
Travnik, till Omer Pashà in 1850 finally crushed the
Capetans and transferred the Vizierial residence once
more to the Serai.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span></p>

<p><i>Aug. 18.</i>—Next morning, while we are still enjoying
hard-earned rest—and let it be recorded, injustice to our
hanjia, that our room was tolerably free from vermin—a
most honourable exception in Bosnia!—in comes the acting
Governor, whose acquaintance we had made the day
before, leading his little boy, decked out in raiment of
purple velvet and crimson silk, with gold brocade and
elaborate arabesques of embroidery—more gorgeously
bedizened than any princeling of our poor civilized West!—and
begs me to photograph, or, failing that, to sketch
the little man. As a camera I had brought with me had
unfortunately come to grief at an early period of our
tour, I was reduced—for all my disavowals of artistic
skill—to attempt what portraiture I could. The child, like
his father, was a true Osmanlì, unlike the light-haired offspring
of the native Sclavonic Mussulmans, dark in eye and
locks, and withal precociously endowed with something
of the gravity of his race. His self-possession, indeed,
was amusing. He could not have been more than six
years old, but he leant quite quietly against his father’s
knees, hardly shifting his position the whole while, and
laid his little hand on the big hilt of his paternal
scimetar—instructed, doubtless, to look all the future
hero! The pride of the fond papa in his hopeful was
an amiable study, though purblind Frankish eyes might
detect little that was remarkable about the prodigy.
Alas! the artist was uninstructed as to those points the
insistance on which was most acceptable to his patron;
and though the Turkish parent was on the whole satisfied
with a scrutiny of my humble performance, he looked up
from the paper with an air of profound art-criticism, and
requested me, as I loved truth, to make the eyebrows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
darker. It was too true; I had not done justice to the
raven pigment!</p>

<p>And the Koràn? it may be asked, what about the
prohibition of the Prophet against the portrayal of living
things? Actually it is observed about as rigorously in
Bosnia as the prohibition against drinking wine. Within
the last year or two a Dalmatian photographer has set
up in Serajevo; and to prove the laxity of morals in this
respect, it may be mentioned that Mahometan priests
have their likenesses taken by him, and that in one case
he was summoned to reproduce a whole group of Turks
engaged in the interment of a fellow-believer.</p>

<p>We found much to interest us in the streets of Travnik,
and indeed the superior architecture of the town still
witnesses its old importance as the seat of government.
There are some larger buildings besides the castle already
mentioned—palaces of bygone Viziers, barracks for
Turkish troops. Even the ordinary rows of wooden
houses—with their latticed dairy-like windows, the central
bays of their upper story, the blue pillars and other ornaments
painted outside—are not without variety in hue and
outline; and amongst these rise more solid edifices of
stone. Here, for instance, is one such—the best in the
town—supported on arcades of solid masonry, adorned
with rosettes carved in the spandrils of the arches: perhaps
an old Bezestan or cloth-hall—very possibly the
magazine of some merchant prince from Ragusa, for the
arcading below is characteristic of the street architecture
of the old republic. Beyond this—we are surveying one
of the most picturesque street scenes in Travnik—rises
an old mosque of wood, time-stained, dilapidated, with
pinnacle awry. At its side an elegant cupola, supported<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
on four columns and ogee arches, encanopies the turbaned
tomb of a Mahometan saint; for every true believer
who falls in battle against the infidel ‘drinks,’ as the
Bosnian historian expresses it, ‘the sweet sherbet of martyrdom,’
and passes from this ‘vale of tears’ to enter with
saintly honours into the joys of Paradise. Beyond these
rose a background of gardens and spreading foliage, and
above, the naked precipices of Mount Vlašić.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus34.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>View in Travnik.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Climbing round by the hills to rejoin the town on
the other side, we gained a more general view of the
city, and counted no less than thirteen minarets, besides
two clock-towers, and—what we had not seen in a Bosnian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
town before—the stone cupolas of the bath and
the larger mosques or dzàmias. The porches of some of
these Mahometan prayer-houses had altered little from
those of the early Christian church, and were in truth
as Byzantine as their domes. The walls are most brilliant,
not to say tawdry, outside—painted with what were
meant to be delectable fore-glimpses of Paradise—palm-trees
loaded with dates, fruitful vines sprouting forth
from vases, or here a luscious melon with a knife ready
inserted for the carving. Like devices might be seen on
the spandrils of the kiosques that rose over the saints’
graves, but all in the most gaudy and inharmonious
colours. Against the walls of some of the mosques were
built the wooden booths of Travnik tradesmen, so that
the disfigurement of sacred edifices by secular accretions
is not confined to Christian countries. The most gorgeous
of all the dzàmias had been converted into a kind
of gathering-ground for the fruit and vegetable market—as
if the fruiterers considered that the celestial fruits
painted on the sanctuary walls above might be useful in
suggesting to customers the propriety of enjoying the
humbler fruits of earth, and serve generally as a good
trade advertisement. It is, however, to be hoped that
the faithful will be supplied with better plums hereafter
than are to be obtained for love or money in the Travnik
market.</p>

<p>Narrow rows lined with the usual open stores—varied
and fascinating as ever. Armourers’ shops, with
<i>handshars</i> or Bosnian cutlasses, yataghans, quaint ornamental
guns and pistols; another store containing
nothing but melons; grindstones next door; two or three
watchmakers—glazed windows to these, and a goodly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
exposure of turnips; as elsewhere, many Jacks-of-all
trades. Among the primitive arts practised here that of
a rope-maker struck me. He held the cord tight with
his great toe, while he twisted it with his fingers. The
inhabitants of Travnik are mostly Moslems, with a small
infusion of Spanish Jews and Serbs, or members of the
Greek Church, some of whom are the most well-to-do
merchants in the place, and have organised a company—the
<i>Kombeni</i>, as it is known here—for facilitating traffic
with Serajevo. Their wives were dressed in the style
which distinguishes the Christian women of Bosnian
towns from those of most country districts, and which
approaches the fashions of Belgrade.</p>

<p>In strange contrast to these were the Mahometan
women, several of whom we noticed in the streets towards
evening. Their whole face was concealed but for
the tiniest eyeslits imaginable; but their insatiable bashfulness
is not contented even with this, for in passing a
stranger they must needs bow the head so that the fringe
of the upper veil which curtains the head falls forward
far enough to eclipse their last loophole of humanity!
Their hands they modestly hide in two front pockets of
their dress. Their exterior envelopes are sometimes green,
sometimes white, sometimes of a darker hue; those
whose under veil is black and outer white, looking at a
little distance strikingly like nuns. Besides the two
ordinary veils—that which drapes the head and that which
swathes the nose, mouth, and bosom—their forehead is
often covered with an additional piece not unlike the
half mask worn at masquerade balls, usually of black
horse-hair, with the two eyeslits above-mentioned fringed
with gold. The whole form is mummied in such a way that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
an Englishman who had travelled through a great deal
of the Ottoman dominions, but who had not visited Bosnia,
could hardly be induced to believe that the figure below
represented a woman of European Turkey. To find her
like, one must transport oneself as far away as Egypt.
Outside the limits of conservative
old Bosnia, her disguise
would be laughed at by the
Turks themselves!</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp30" id="illus35" style="max-width: 12.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus35.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Bosniac Mahometan Woman.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But what is still stranger
is that in Bosnia should coexist
the two extremes of veiling
and not veiling. If the
married women here veil themselves
more than anywhere else,
<i>en revanche</i> unmarried girls
are allowed to display their
charms in a way which, to the
well regulated Turk of another
province when he first visits
Bosnia, is quite scandalous.
There is a Turkish proverb, ‘Go to Bosnia if you wish
to see your betrothed!’ It is actually a fact that in
this reactionary land there are such things as Mahometan
love-matches; and even when the mother is allowed
to select the spouse in the usual way, by inspecting,
that is, the ‘stock’ in the baths, even then—so demoralized
are the customs of these Mahometan Sclaves!—the
young people are allowed to converse together before
tying the conjugal knot. On Fridays and Mondays—days
of greater liberty to all the Mahometan women—lovers
may steal up to their sweethearts’ windows<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
and whisper airy nothings to them through the lattice.
This Bosnian custom is called <i>aschyklik</i>, and has been
compared with the <i>Fensterln</i> of Styria and Upper Austria.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>Mondays and Fridays, and through a lattice—what
restrictions can be more judicious?</p>

<p>Lamentable to record, the day was a Wednesday and
the place a public fountain in the street of Travnik. A
Mahometan girl, very slightly veiled, was drawing water,
when up comes a young fellow with the ostensible purpose
of doing the same. He was a gay deceiver!—she
might have told it from his roguish look,—but for the
honour of Islâm my pen refuses to chronicle the rest.
Of course the artless maiden gave vent to a ‘<i>Haiti!</i>’ but
in a tone so soft, so insinuating, as abundantly to prove
that that word of dismissal is capable of as many interpretations
as ‘get along, do!’ among certain she-Giaours,
and to be the natural prelude to more mutual oglings,
and squeezes, and gigglings, cut short by the appearance
of an unwelcome third party in the distance—retributive
Propriety herself, advancing like a walking sack.</p>

<p>Not many years ago a tragic love romance had Travnik
for its scene. In the days of the last struggle of
feudal Bosnia for her provincial liberties, a young
Osmanlì sergeant of Omer Pashà’s army, who was stationed
here, fell in love with the pretty daughter of a
Bosniac Mussulman, and was betrothed to her. Before
they could be married, however, the sergeant fell in battle,
and the maiden, when she heard of the death of her
beloved, rather than survive him and be forced to marry
another, blew out her brains with a pistol. The moral
drawn by Omer Pashà, in relating this tragic story, was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
admirable. ‘It all comes of not wearing the veil, and
letting affianced couples see each other. If she had
always kept her <i>yashmak</i> on her face she might have
married another man, for there would have been no
great love in the matter.’<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a></p>

<p>This approach towards natural relations between the
two sexes is doubtless, as much else among the Bosniac
Mussulmans, a survival of the old Sclavonic family life.
The Mahometan house in Bosnia more nearly approaches
our idea of <i>home</i> than in any other part of Turkey. We
learnt that polygamy was almost non-existent throughout
the province. It has been dying out, it is true, in other
parts of Turkey, but here it appears never to have taken.
What is still perhaps exceptional among the wealthier
Turks, the richest Bosniacs have only one wife. Some
of them are said to have concubines, but public opinion
here denounces the Moslem who concludes more than
one marriage. A few years ago a representative of the
old feudal nobility, Ali-Beg Dzinić, one of the richest
landholders in the country, set all Bosnia in an uproar
by taking a second wife in the lifetime of the first.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a>
Another peculiarity of these Mussulman Sclaves, illustrating
the vitality of the family tie, is to be found in their
names. Mahometans elsewhere, with the exception of
Persians and Arabs, have no family name; but here, after
the orthodox personal appellation, as in the instance
above, to the Ali, or Méhchmet, or Selim, these descendants
of the old Bosnian nobles add their ancestral
patronymic. This, however, is confined to the grandees,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
and is rather an instance of the tenacity with which the
Bosnian aristocracy has clung to its old feudal attributes.</p>

<p>After all, one ought rather perhaps to wonder that
these Sclavonic renegades have received so much of the
impress of Islâm. Considering the difference of race—how
strange it is to see a bevy of blue-eyed light-haired
Mahometans!—it is curious what thorough Turks these
Travnik burghers make. Towards evening many of
these grave merchants seated themselves in the gardens
of a café just outside the town, and, while alternately
purring their narghilés and sipping their coffee, contemplated,
without uttering a syllable, the beautiful scene
before them—the mountains, the green valley, the foaming
mill-stream murmuring at their feet.</p>

<p>We were assured by ‘Europeans’ in Bosnia that the
Turks do not care a rap for nature—that they are utterly
callous as to scenery; that if anything charmed, it was
the peace, the silence—not the beauties of the landscape.
It is this, they say, which allures the Turk to seek
as his greatest luxury the gardens of his country house.
Yet old Edward Brown,<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> in his ‘Travels in the Levant,’
in the seventeenth century, records how the Grand
Signior passed two months on Mount Olympus, not only
for the coolness of the air in summer, but also for the
sake of enjoying the prospect of the fair champaign of
Thessaly on one side and the blue expanse of the Ægean
on the other. For flowers at least, all Bosniacs, Mussulman
as well as Christian, display an extraordinary love;
not only do they adorn their persons with them on every
possible occasion, but so great is their craving for them,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
that at Serajevo it is not unfrequent for mendicants to
station themselves at the doors of our Consulate to beg
not for bread, but for a single flower from the pretty
little garden.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there sit our Turks, to all outward appearance
rapt in the enjoyment of the picturesque. What
sapient big-wigs, too, they look!—how profoundly versed
in all the Law and the Prophets!—of what superfluity
of braininess are those capacious turbans suggestive!
It is hard to realise that these gentlemanly beings have
been engaged all day in peddling trades. And indeed
it is true that they forego with lordly disdain the petty
chicaneries of their calling; it is notorious, among
foreigners in Bosnia most hostile to the Mahometans, that
wares are, as a rule, to be bought cheaper and of better
quality with them, than at stores kept by Christians. The
true believer will not wilfully cheat, and disdains to bargain.
This is always put down to their fatalism; but I
doubt if it be not more due to a certain personal dignity
which the plastic Sclave of Bosnia has borrowed from the
Osmanlì.</p>

<p>One would expect the brows of a pure fatalist to be
smooth as marble. There could be, one would think, no
trace of emotions to which he is superior. But the
features of these Bosniac Mahometans are fretted with a
positive network of wrinkles—far more than those of an
average Englishman. The truth is that, superior as they
are to many of the ‘changes and chances of this mortal
world,’ they, too, have their weak points, and vanities of
their own, about which they are touchy as other people.
It is their wish on all occasions to seem oracular, to be
lawgivers, to impress you with the profundity of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
learning, to give the idea that they know a great deal
more than they choose to say—to make up for the
paucity of their observations by accentuating their value.
Thus on the slightest occasion they will elevate or depress
their brow, and otherwise contort the features with a
kind of measured emphasis. The wrinkling process resembles
that of the dogmatic and self-important type of
German; it is the very opposite to that theatrical adaptiveness
which leaves the footprints of every emotion on
the Zingar’s face. Not indeed that the expression arrived
at smacks by any means of Teutonic cantankerousness; it
is rather a Spanish <i>Grandezza</i>—a stately condescending
politeness—which converts every shopkeeper you converse
with into a Grand Signior!</p>

<p>Of course in their manner of life and their way of
conducting business there are traces enough of the numbing
influences of fatalism. Though these Mahometan
tradesmen are distinguished by their honesty, which, as
everybody knows, is also the best policy, though they
are favoured by belonging to the ruling caste, there is
a want of enterprise among them which precludes them
from favourably competing with the Christians. Almost
all the larger businesses in the country are in Christian
hands; the Mahometans are shopkeepers at most, not
merchants—they are too stationary by temperament.
Perhaps they indulge more than the rayahs in narcotics;
it was woful to see the ghastly pallor of so many
Turkish faces. Here and there in the course of our
journey amusing features in Mahometan interiors bore
witness of the <i>laisser-aller</i> spirit of the inmates. In the
Konak at Tešanj was a writing-table made for no less a
personage than the Kaïmakàm, and it was put together<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>
with bits of wood of uneven sizes, just as they came handy;
and here, in the telegraph office at Travnik, was another—quite
an elegant escritoir—but the whole spoilt and
rendered ridiculous by a piece of wood of insufficient
length being stuck in the middle, Providence having
been pleased to place it in the way of the upholsterer.
If a button comes off an official’s coat, he never thinks of
replacing it; and if a beast dies before a Bosniac’s house,
instead of removing it, or even burying it, he leaves it
there to stink!</p>

<p>To-day we noticed a certain amount of positive manifestations,
and those directed against ourselves. Many of
the believers scowled as we passed, and one old fellow
did me the distinguished honour of coming up and
cursing me in the middle of the street. Once a Mahometan
store-keeper positively refused to sell any of
his wares to the Giaour—the Kaur, as the Bosniacs call
him—and I should have been unable to procure the
‘lumps of delight’ which I affected, had not a Serb merchant,
whose acquaintance I had made, come up and
explained that I was neither a Russian, nor an Austrian,
but an Englishman, on which the Turk relented at once.
We were, however, more seriously annoyed by being followed
wheresoever we went by a Zaptieh; and at last,
unable to stand such persecution any longer, betook
ourselves to the telegraph office to demand an explanation
from our French-speaking friend.</p>

<p>‘You see,’ said he, ‘he has orders from the prefect
of police to follow you.’</p>

<p>‘To follow us! So he still takes us for spies, then?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, that is not the reason! It is simply for your
safety. You see we are in a very critical state: the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
Mahometans here are very fanatical—they may rise
against the Christians at any moment.’ Had he said,
as indeed was the case, that they were actually rising
in the neighbouring town of Banjaluka—that the Christians
of Bosnia had risen against the Turks—that the
Turkish burghers had in places flown to arms in self-defence—that
massacres were being perpetrated all along
the Save—he would have put us more on our guard.
As it was, by subsequently admitting that we were still
suspected to be insurgent emissaries, he destroyed the
effect of his previous warning, and left us as averse to
having a Zaptieh clattering at our heels as we had been
before. Perhaps, too, we were rather obtuse in not reading
the signs of the times more clearly. During the
whole day raw levies, not regulars, not redìf or reserve,
but the old Bashi Bazouks, Mahometan volunteers dressed
in the ordinary country costumes—the red turban and
sash, loaded with antiquated pistols and <i>handshars</i> or
short sword-knives—had been streaming into the town.
Some of them were beating a diabolical tattoo on drums
shaped like the bowls of spoons—quite in harmony with
the savage aspect of the warriors. During the night we
were frequently woke up by bugle-calls, and next morning
the uproar had rather increased. We, however,
knowing with what brotherly feelings the Bosniac Turks
regarded Englishmen, felt no uneasiness on our own
account. So that leaving L⸺ at the Han, I hesitated
not to sally forth alone, unencumbered either with escort
or a revolver, to sketch the old castle.</p>

<p>This, like the other old castles we have seen, belongs
to the days of the Christian kingdom, and is in fact said
to have been the work of Tvartko, the first King of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
Bosnia.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> In form and general aspect it is very much the
same as the Starigrads of Doboj and Tešanj. Like them
it terminates at one angle in a polygonal tower; and,
like them, is more remarkable for its situation than the
beauty of its architecture. It rises on a peninsular rock
with ravines on every side, except where a low narrow
neck connects it with the mountains, which dominate
it so completely that it would be quite untenable at present,
though the Turks seem still to use it as a kind of
arsenal.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp63" id="illus36" style="max-width: 26.5625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus36.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Old Castle of King Tvartko at Travnik.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span></p>

<p>While I was drawing this venerable ruin I became
unpleasantly conscious that a battery of some kind or
other was opening a lively fire on me from the rear, and
presently, a larger stone than usual whizzing past my
head, I thought it high time to make a reconnaissance,
and looking round perceived that the enemy chiefly
consisted of a lad of about fourteen. Seeing me get up
with no very amiable intentions, the urchin fell back on
his reserves, a group of armed Turks, to whom I made
unmistakable signs that I should consider it a favour if
they would restrain the enthusiasm of youthful Islâm;
and having thus given vent to my feelings I returned
tranquilly to my drawing. Then it was that a well-aimed
missile—judging by the sensation it produced, larger than
any of its predecessors—hit me on the middle of the
back; and this time, being thoroughly roused, I went for
our young artilleryman in such earnest that he made for
a neighbouring house, and slamming the door, disappeared
from my indignant view. Whereat, being still in
a very pretty temper, I knocked at the door with my
stick, hoping at least to wreak vicarious vengeance on
the rascal by means of his parents. While in vain attempting
to gain an interview with the inmates, one of
the group of Turks with whom the boy had first taken
refuge came up and shouted to me ‘Tursko! Tursko!’
meaning that the boy being a Turk might throw as many
stones as he liked at the cursed Giaour.</p>

<p>Finally, as neither knocking nor thumping made any
impression on the door, and myself beginning to recover
from this ‘short madness,’ I went back to my original
station, and was putting a few finishing touches to my
sketch, when the door of refuge opened; the lad, accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
by two armed Turks—one on either side—issued
forth, and the three swaggered up to me to insult the
dog of a Christian at their leisure.</p>

<p>This was more than mortal patience could stand.
I got up, and, disregarding the menaces of the two
self-constituted guardians, who, seeing that I meditated
some act of personal chastisement on their protégé,
shouted ‘Tursko! Tursko!’ ‘He’s a Turk! he’s a Turk!’
in tone as if they would bid me lick the dust off the
urchin’s feet, I simply said, ‘Inglese!’<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> ‘I’m an Englishman!’
and gave the stripling a good hearty box on the
ears. The rage of the Turks knew no bounds. For a
moment they recoiled a few paces as if struck dumb with
amazement; then, with a look of fury one of them drew
his sword-knife and was making at me, but before he
had time to disentangle it from its sash or its sheath, I
was on him with my stick—happily a good heavy one—and
the coward let go his <i>handshar</i> and took to his heels.
The other Turk, who was beginning to draw his weapon,
imitated the example of his mate; the boy ran off in
another direction, and I was left in possession of the
field. As, however, I was not prepared to withstand all
Travnik in arms, and as it seemed possible that this spark
might serve to kindle that conflagration of fanaticism which
the official had warned us was imminent, I profited by
the impression I had made to retreat in good order to
our Han, where were my reserves and munitions; and
with L⸺ once more by my side, and our revolvers in
our hands, felt more at ease. Meanwhile there was an
ominous hum in the town, and it was perhaps fortunate
that a Zaptieh shortly arrived to escort us in the other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
direction to the Prefect of Police, as our French interpreter
styled him, who demanded our immediate attendance.</p>

<p>On our way we passed through a kind of <i>Champ de
Mars</i>, with a row of light field-pieces glittering in the
sunshine, and swarming with a motley array of those organised
brigands, the Bashi Bazouks. Drums were beating,
trumpets were sounding, a Tartar messenger in his
long coat was riding up post haste to the Konak, and
large crowds of citizens were assembled to see a body of
these Mahometan volunteers march out of the town for
Banjaluka. It was becoming more and more unintelligible
to us why troops against Herzegovinian insurgents should
be wanted there, and the real truth that we were in for
a Bosnian insurrection was beginning to dawn upon us.</p>

<p>These suspicions were confirmed by the official who
had ‘wanted’ us. After re-inspecting our <i>bujuruldu</i>, he
informed us, by means of an Italian interpreter, that we
were on no account to go to Foinica (where was another
Franciscan monastery), as we intended; that a Zaptieh
was attached to us, and an Arabà provided to take us
straight to Serajevo. So there was nothing for it but to
start as if we acquiesced in the arrangement, without,
however, in the least relinquishing our intentions. To
the last we were taken (so it turned out) for Austrian
emissaries, and it was thought desirable to prevent us
from holding any communication with the Roman
Catholic monks of Foinica.</p>

<p>So we started on our way, ostensibly bound for Serajevo,
in a covered waggon, escorted by a Zaptieh, and
left Travnik unmolested. The four hours’ jolt to Busovac,
where we were to sleep, gave us sufficient experience<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
of what a Turkish high-road can be. To cross a
bridge was like driving over a row of fallen trunks, with the
additional pleasing uncertainty as to whether or not the
whole would give way and let us down into the stream below.
As to the water-culverts over the lesser brooks, they
were almost always broken in, but the horses were equal
to the occasion, and always succeeded in jumping the
cart over—which itself was springless. At one part we
came to a newly-made piece of road, and this was like
passing over a succession of heaps of unbroken stones.
A precipice yawned at one side, and another cliff rose
sheer above us on the other, so that when in the middle
of this strait we came upon a monster waggon which had
foundered in the vain attempt to make use of the new
piece of road, and had taken root as it seemed among
large blocks of rock, a serious stoppage occurred; and it
was not until after considerable delay that all the levering
and pushing and pulling, of our horses, ourselves, our
driver, our Zaptieh, and the crew of the foundered waggon,
could extricate our cart—which here performed the
most extraordinary antics.</p>

<p>But here we are safe at our destination at last; nor
are we sorry to have arrived, for our Zaptieh has shown
unmistakable signs of insubordination. Once, to our great
indignation, he swooped on some unfortunate rayahs,
and, before we had time to prevent it, ‘requisitioned’
them of some bread, for which, to the great surprise of
all parties, we paid, as the quickest way out of the difficulty:
besides this, our escort and driver thought themselves
privileged to drink raki at our expense at every
Han they came to, till we took effectual means to disabuse
them of the notion that <i>we</i> were going to pay for it!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span></p>

<p>The country we have been passing through is not so
rich as the Possávina and the lower vale of Bosna; the
crops generally were poor, the mountains were covered
with less stately forest growth, and indeed out of the valleys
the trees here became quite scrubby. Thus there is
a comparative want of softness about the mountain scenery;
the conical limestone hills, with their scrubby overgrowth,
looking like frozen folds of green drapery, Düreresque in
its stiffness and angularity.</p>

<p>Busovac, where we are stopping for the night, is a
village of about 700 inhabitants, with a couple of mosques
rising among low houses, each in its little enclosure with
the shed for kukurutz, the small dwelling-house, the
square hearth and fire-dogs, all as in Slavonia and Croatia,
but on a smaller scale. Hearing that there was a Roman
Catholic chapel here, we asked to be allowed to see it,
and were conducted by the priest through some backyards
and houses to a small shed, where a plain room
was fitted up with an altar, a few crucifixes, and pictures.
The priest conversed with us in Latin; he also knew a
smattering of German. He was inclined to do full justice
to the tolerance of the Turks, who, he said, did not
molest the Latin Christians here in any way.</p>

<p>We entered our Han—which is a fair sample of the
ordinary house of the better-off Mahometans in Bosnia—by
an archway on either side of which are the stables
and abodes of menials, and found ourselves in a court (a
garden in private houses) from which we ascended by an
out-door staircase to the Divanhané, a gallery running
the whole length of the house, and overlooking the yard or
garden, but secured from view by a lattice. From the middle
of this a kind of transept runs out to the front of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
house with a bay overlooking the street, and this recess
is spread with mats and cushions for the usual mid-day
siesta. On either side of this central hall are the rooms
with doors opening on to the gallery. We found ours
fairly clean, our Hanjia obliging, and altogether fared
very well. Our repast consisted of a soup compounded
of milk and rice, very fine trout, a chicken very well
roasted, and succeeded by kaimak<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> with little bits of
sugar floating in it—all excellent; so that it is possible to
<i>dine</i> even in Bosnia.</p>

<p>Next morning we discovered to our sincere pleasure
that our Zaptieh had levanted, so that we had less difficulty
than we anticipated in adhering to our original
itinerary and defying the Travnik authorities. We drove
a few miles further on the Serajevo road in our waggon,
and then, stopping at a roadside Han, informed our driver
that we had no further need of his services. He seemed
at first considerably taken aback at this <i>coup</i>, but as we
gave him all that was his due had he carried us to the
capital, we left him well satisfied. Our next care was to
secure a guide over the mountains to Foinica, nor were
we long in finding a peasant willing to conduct us. He
only asked us to excuse him a few minutes, and presently
returned with a serviceable cutlass—rather an ominous
beginning to our mountain journey! Our way ran along
a gradually ascending footpath winding over the undulations
of the Zahorina Planina, and through beechy defiles—the
trees not indeed so fine as those of Troghìr and
Mazulia Planina, but very beautiful. The flowers and
ferns were much the same as we had seen before, but the
beech-fern now for the first time became plentiful, and so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
surpassing rich were the tufts of male fern that we seemed
to be passing through a gigantic fernery. Now and then
we emerged on glades and a few scattered fields, with
huts surrounded by fruit-trees, and there were plenty of
wild walnut-trees on the mountain itself.</p>

<p>As we ascended the main ridge we detected the first
sign of the wealth stored up in the bowels of the mountain,
from the mineral taste of the springs; and as we
began to descend the southern slopes, the same cause
seemed to blight the growth of beech and oak, and in
some parts the mountain-side showed bare, while streaks
of mica rock glittered like silver in the sunshine. The
soil itself from a pale brown took rich ochreous hues, so
that the range was not without its golden streaks as well.
Here and there our path was strewn with bits of crystalline
quartz, and we picked up pieces of iron, lead, and
even—we believe—silver ore; and here and there fragments
of noble crystals. At the summit our guide had
left us, and a steep and rough descent brought us to the
village of Foinica.</p>

<p>On our way down we passed some sooty-looking
blacksmiths, and a mule laden with their stock-in-trade—theirs
being the chief industry of the village. We crossed
a bridge over a stream, and were threading our way
along one of the narrow lanes of Foinica, when a hue and
cry was raised behind us, of which at first we took no
notice—on principle—till the sound of hurried footsteps
close behind us told us that the demonstration, of whatever
kind it was, could no longer be conveniently ignored;
and, looking round, we discovered a Zaptieh making after
us, and flourishing a pistol in a warlike manner. Then it
was that we drew forth our magic pass, and there being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
someone by who could read it—an extraordinary occurrence—we
were allowed to proceed on our way. As,
however, we were attempting to ascend to the monastery,
a barrack-like pile perched on a rocky platform above
the town, another Zaptieh stopped us and bade us
accompany him to the Konak, where we found a man
who spoke Italian, and after a long preliminary ‘interviewing’
were told that the Kaïmakàm<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> desired to see us.</p>

<p>So we were conducted some way off to a garden
by the stream, where we took his dignity at a disadvantage,
for he was engaged, when we appeared on the
scene, in the presumably unofficial act of dabbling in the
shallow water, and was in a decided state of dishabille.
However, he emerged on to terra firma, not the least disconcerted;
and having, with due circumspection, arrayed
himself in his dressing-gown and slippers, advanced towards
us with undiminished grandeur, and went through
the saluting process as if neither he nor ourselves had
been conscious of each other’s presence till that moment.
Then, bidding us take our seat upon mats spread upon the
grass in the shade of a spreading pear-tree, he treated us
to cigarettes and questioned us, by means of the Italian
interpreter, as to the objects of our travelling and the
places we had been to. While this was going on, several
more Turks equally dignified made their appearance,
arrayed in the long gowns of undress. These turned out
to be the Mudìr, the Kadi, and the Imaum, each of whom
went through the usual <i>temena</i>, or greeting, by touching
in turn his head, mouth, and bosom, thereby intimating,
in the majestic symbolism of the East, that in thoughts,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
words, and heart, he was equally loyal to us. From the
subsequent arrival of a <i>tepsia</i>, several mysterious covers,
and a roast lamb spitted in the usual way, we perceived
that we were intruding on a pic-nic <i>à la Turque</i>, and accordingly
expressed our desire of adjourning to the monastery,
whither the Italian-speaking Effendi was dispatched
to conduct us, the Kaïmakàm having first given orders
that we should be provided with an arabà for our onward
journey. The Kaïmakàm had previously asked us
whether we were Romanists or Protestants, possibly not
wishing us in the former case to have an opportunity of
conversing with co-religionists.</p>

<p>Climbing up to the rocky height on which the monastery
stood, we found ourselves in another cloistered court,
not unlike what we had seen at Gučiagora. Outside was
an old foliated cross, much the same as that which we
had noticed at the other monastery, and dating, according
to the monks, three hundred years back; but the
buildings themselves were almost entirely of the present
century. Inside the court we knocked at a door labelled in
gold letters ‘Clausura;’ but no one opened it. Presently,
however, a monk sauntered up from another direction,
evidently to reconnoitre who the strangers might be before
letting them into the sanctum—in troubled times a not
unnecessary precaution. Seeing a Mahometan official
with us he at once became, as the French say, <i>boutonné</i>;
protested that there was nothing within worth our inspection;
and when we told him our reason for visiting the
monastery, which was to see the curious old Bosnian
monuments contained there, went so far as to deny that
any such existed.</p>

<p>We were beginning to despair of gaining admittance<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
after this, and should probably have gone away without
seeing the most interesting antiquity, perhaps, in the whole
of Bosnia—the book, namely, of the Old Christian Nobility,
as it existed before the conquest—had it not been
for our old friend, <i>the Major</i>. In his official capacity Major
Roskiević had obtained admission to this monastery. As
an Austrian and a good Catholic, he had disarmed the
suspicions of the monks, and had been admitted to a sight
of their invaluable treasure. The Major, though as a
rule he does not trouble himself about antiquities, had
engraved one of the old designs illuminated in the book—the
armorial bearings, namely, of the old kings of
Bosnia; and as I happened to have copied and duly
coloured this as an appropriate device for the outside of
my note-book, and possible credentials to Bosniac Christians,
I took it out of my pocket, and, as a last resource,
held it up to the monk.</p>

<p>It proved an ‘open sesamé’ indeed! The monk, who
thoroughly believed that no soul outside the monastic
walls knew of the existence of the Book of Arms, much
less that anyone possessed a facsimile of any of its illuminations,
was visibly taken aback. The change that
passed over his whole demeanour was most amusing.
He no longer attempted to deny that the book we sought
existed within, and was now as ready to welcome us inside
as he had before been to keep us out. Another monk,
who had come up during the conversation, which was held
in Latin, went off to consult the Prior of the monastery, and
there was something of the ‘Arabian Nights’ in the way
in which the ‘Clausura’ door flew open, and a saintly
vision of the Superior of the fraternity himself appeared
above, beckoning us upstairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span></p>

<p>We were now ushered into a guest-room of much the
same kind as at Gučiagora, and were treated with coffee
and Bosnian wine in the same hospitable way, while the
Prior and several of the brothers clustered round, and we
conversed in German and Latin on our own travels, and
the history and prospects of the country; the monks betraying
that of the present state of affairs they knew more
than they chose to tell. Presently, to our no small delight,
the Prior went to an antique chest, and, unlocking it,
brought out the old Book of Arms. It was enclosed in
a worn vellum cover, and at the beginning was a Bosnian
inscription, written in old Serbian characters, which,
Englished, ran as follows:—</p>

<p>‘The Book of Arms of the Nobility of Bosnia or Illyria,
and Serbia, together set forth by Stanislaus Rubčić,
priest, to the glory of Stephen Némanja, Czar of the
Serbs and Bosnians. In the year 1340.’<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a></p>

<p>Thus it was a monument of that most interesting moment
in Bosnian history when, for a while, she formed
part of that greater empire of the Némanjas, which seemed
about to weld all the scattered Serbian populations between
the Ægean, the Danube, and the Adriatic into one great
State. It must not, however, be thought that this MS.
itself dated back to the times of Czar Dūshan. The most
cursory glance was sufficient to convince me that the
book, in its present state, was a later copy. The designs
were still mediæval, but the painting belonged to a period
when the art of illuminating was almost dead. They
were executed, not on parchment, as doubtless the original<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
was, but on paper, which, however, was without any
water-mark, and in places so polished by fingering as to
look like vellum. The copyist, moreover, had left his
mark in several mis-spelt and bungled words. That it
was the original, as the monks asserted, cannot therefore
for a moment be maintained, but I have no wish to deny
that it was written previous to the Turkish conquest; and
I warn any who may harbour such a wish that they have
to reckon with Apostolic authority. At the beginning
of the book is a short Latin note dated 1800, in which
Gregorius, Episcopus Ruspensis, and Vicar Apostolic of
Bosnia, certifies ‘that this codex has from time immemorial,
namely, from the captivity of the kingdom of
Bosnia, been zealously preserved by the reverend Franciscan
brothers of the family of Foinica.’<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p>Upon the first page was blazoned the Queen of Heaven
with the Child on her knees, seated on a golden half-moon.
St. Mary was in the middle ages the tutelary goddess
of Bosnia, and the crescent is the chosen emblem of
Illyria. Next followed a picture of a saint attended by a
lion, and intended, if the monks informed us rightly, to
represent St. Martin.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> This was succeeded by two saints
beneath a cross, one of them holding a branch; these
were Saints Cosmas and Damian, the doughty patrons of
the Némanjas, whose effigies are still traceable among the
rich frescoes of their chosen shrines.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span></p>

<p>This, therefore, formed a fitting preface to the armorial
bearings of the great Serbian Czar himself. Above
the shield appeared a crowned helmet, whose crest was
the double-headed eagle of empire, supporting another
rayed crown. On either side were two other casques,
each crested with two lions,—I take it, from a Macedonian
den,—crowned and guardant. The shield itself was
divided into eleven compartments; in the centre reappeared
the double eagle of the Némanjas, argent on a
field gules, and round this were quartered the arms of all
the provinces of his empire. Here was the red, crowned
lion of Macedonia (this alone appeared in two quarters);
the Moorish trophies of Bosnia; the Slavonian leash of
hounds; the three bearded kings of Dalmatia; the
chequers, gules and argent of Croatia; the rampant lion
of Bulgaria; the Serbian battle-axes; the three horse-shoes
of Rascia; the armour-cased arm of Primorie, holding
aloft her sable scimetar.</p>

<p>The original of this comprehensive escutcheon was
devised fifteen years before Czar Dūshan marched with
such sanguine hopes to seize Byzantium; and already we
see him claiming sway over a territory which embraces the
southern provinces of modern Austria, and the greater
part of Turkey-in-Europe. The Eastern question was
nearer a felicitous solution then than it ever has been
since! Had Dūshan found a successor worthy to support
his shield, or to wear the double-eagled casque, in all
human probability the Turk would never have made good
his footing in Europe, the dotard Greeklings of Byzantium
would have given place to a youthful power capable of
acting as the champion of Christendom and of competing
successfully with the civilization of the West; and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
different destiny of these Sclavonic lands might nowhere
have been more conspicuous than in this very valley—so
rich in the mineral wealth of nature, so deficient in human
industry! <i>Dîs aliter placitum</i>; and were Czar Dūshan
himself to return from the grave, he might well shrink
from the attempt to form anew the Serbian empire; or
if he attempted to cut the knot of complications by the
sword, he would find himself opposed not only by Turkish
scimetars, but more effectually by the ignoble jealousies
of Christendom; and, in a last resort, by the arms of military
monarchies, whose rulers prefer to have for neighbours
decrepit infidels whom they can bully at their pleasure,
to see a Christian State rise on their borders, which
might some day form a healthy rival!</p>

<p>After the arms of Stephen Dūshan follow those of
the various Illyrian provinces in detail, as being more
immediately involved in this Armorial of Nobility. Illyria
herself as a unity does not figure in the Czar’s shield,
but her crescent beneath a star of eight points follows,
argent on a field gules. This design appears in the
centre of the Bosnian arms; to betoken—so the monks
assured us—that Bosnia is the heart of Illyria. One is
at once struck with its general resemblance to the star
and crescent of the Turks, though their star is at one
side of the moon instead of above it. Indeed the presence
of these emblems on the Bosnian arms has given rise to
the erroneous idea that they were imposed by the Turks
as a badge of suzerainty on their conquest of the country.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
The monks, however, were undoubtedly right in referring
the star and crescent on the Bosnian shield to her Illyrian
connexions; and in fact, in the title at the beginning of
the book, Bosnia and Illyria are made synonymous.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp57" id="illus37" style="max-width: 15.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus37.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Bosnian Armorial Bearings.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Besides the star and crescent, the Bosnian arms consisted
of two crossed stakes, sable on ground or, each surmounted
by the head of a Moorish king. These trophies
appeared in the arms of several
of the nobles contained in the
volume, and recalled the long
struggles of the Sea Serbs with
the African corsairs. The early
annals of Ragusa—or, as the Serbs
call her, Dubrovnik, who often
stood in peculiarly close relations
with Bosnia, being practically
her seaport and emporium—are
much occupied with these Saracenic infestations, which
extended along the whole Serbian coastland to Albania,
and at one time desolated the Bocche di Cattaro. These
trophies bear interesting witness to the deep impression
left by those struggles on the national mind; and point
to those early days when Trajekto on the Bocche di
Cattaro was the residence of a Bosnian Ban.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span></p>

<p>The scimetar on the arms of Primorie, or Serbia-on-the-Sea,
seems to refer to these same struggles, and I cannot help
suspecting that here is also to be found the true clue towards
solving the mystery of the appearance of the star and
crescent on the Illyrian escutcheon. The Moslems had early
appropriated the old Byzantine half-moon,<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> and Richard
Cœur de Lion, on returning from his wars in Palestine,
added it as a Saracenic trophy to his royal seal. The moon
and stars appear on the Irish coins of John. Nothing could
have been more natural than for the Illyrian Serbs engaged
in the long contests with the Saracen corsairs to have
added this device to their shields for the same reason.</p>

<p>Following the escutcheons of the various Illyrian kingdoms
come those of the nobility—there being no less than
126 families whose armorial bearings are blazoned in this
book. How much is here to throw a light on the extension
of Western ideas over the old Serbian area! How
much to illustrate the national history, the national customs—aye,
even the old Sclavonic mythology; how much
to recall the origin of illustrious dynasties! I have spoken
of the Némanjić ensigns; here, too, were the Castriotić,
belonging to the family of Scanderbeg—again, a double-eagle,
sable on or, and eagle crest to the helm—the arms
of the royal house of Bosnia that was to be—the Tvartkoević
shield semé of golden fleurs de lys. In many of the
arms might be detected a curious play on words. The
Kopiević arms, for example, had four lances, in allusion to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
the Bosnian word for a lance, <i>Kopje</i>. <i>Brzo</i> is the native
word for ‘quick,’ and the device of the Barzoevic family
is a fish in water. More interesting still is the occasional
cropping up of the heathen Sclavonic mythology—chiefly
seen in the frequent appearance of <i>zmaje</i> or dragons, who
play so important a part in Serbian folk-lore; and—more
fascinating than these fire-drakes—the Vila herself appears
on the shield of the Mergnjavić—long-haired and
devoid of raiment as in Serbian poetry: the guardian
nymph of the race, holding aloft the eagle banner of
empire.</p>

<p>The book appropriately concluded with a shield
charged with the armorial bearings of the united Bosnian
Nobility; and the monks, with an enthusiasm worthy of
record, pointed out the motto—read by the light of after
events, not without its pathos—<span class="smcap">Semper Spero</span>.</p>

<p>As this heraldic pageant passes before us—these
knightly shields and helms, with their crests, supporters,
and accoutrements—the imagination is kindled to realize
how these isolated regions fitted once into the polity of
mediæval Europe. Here, too, in these barbarous neglected
lands, the romantic brilliance of chivalry has once held
sway. For a moment the Paynim surroundings are forgotten—we
wake, and find ourselves still within the limits
of Christendom militant. We hear the herald’s trump.
The barriers that to-day wall off Bosnia from the West
sink at the potent blast like the towers of some Eastern
magician. The names, the armorial bearings, recall the
European cousin-hood of that hierarchy of birth. In due
order among the escutcheons of Bosnian nobles appears
the shield of the <i>Frangepani</i>; that of the Rusciević
family reproduces the oriflamme of France: next in order,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
by a curious coincidence, follows that of the Sestrićić,
strewn with Tudor roses.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> Perhaps it would be impossible
for any other monument to recall more vividly than
this Book of Arms, at once the futile dreams of Serbian
empire, the wreck of Bosnian kingship, and that dastardly
abjuration by her nobles of country and belief.</p>

<p>Or what fitter repository for such a monument than
this Minorite monastery? Here, perhaps, better than
anywhere else, one perceives how it is among these Franciscan
brotherhoods that the traditions of the old Bosnian
kingdom most live on. The genealogic lore evinced by
the monks with regard to the old nobility was quite surprising
to us; they seemed to have the pedigrees by
heart; they betrayed sources of information not open to the
outside world. To understand how this happens one need
only call to mind that for the most part the royal
race and magnates were in fact but a Roman Catholic
minority, holding sway over heretics and Greeks, and
that next after the Magyar battle-axe, their mainstay lay
in the influence and organisation of these very monks.
Thus it befell that, when the crash came, these Franciscan
brotherhoods emerged, the only stable remnant from the
wreck of the old <i>régime</i>. It was in their cloisters that
the surviving supporters of Bosnian loyalty rallied; and
those who in that supreme moment of national prostration
would neither fly nor play the renegade, found safety
in the bosom of the Church. The monks confided to us
that two of the noble families of Bosnia were still represented
in the fraternity—the Aloupović and Radieljević.</p>

<p>Others, without actually taking the cowl, seem to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
have found retirement from generation to generation,
under shadow, as it were, of the monastery. In the village
of Foinica below, a poor rayah family perpetuates
the noble race of Kristić; and—more interesting still—the
Christian inmates of another Foinican hovel still exult
in the royal name of Tvrdkoiević, and preserve the
lineage of those Bosnian kings whose mighty castles we
have seen at Doboj, Tešanj, and Travnik.</p>

<p>The Franciscans were, in fact, put forward to make
terms for Catholic Bosnia with the conqueror; and it was
the head of the Foinica brotherhood, Angelo Zvizdović,
who took the lead; and advancing like a new Leo to the
camp of the terrible Sultan, gained from Mahomet II.,
on the field of Milodraz in 1463, the great charter of the
Franciscans. This was the <i>Atname</i>.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> The Sultan, in this
firman, orders that no one shall in any way molest the
Bosnian brothers, either in their person, or their property,
or their churches; that those who have fled the
realm may return, and that the brothers may bring any
person they choose from foreign parts into the country.
‘And I swear by the great God, the creator of heaven
and earth, by the seven books, by the great prophets, by
the 124,000 prophets, and by the sabre which I wear,
that no one shall act counter to these commands so long
as these monks do my bidding and are obedient to my
service.’</p>

<p>Nor need it surprise us that it was to Foinica that
Roman and aristocratic Bosnia turned in the hour of
need. The local history of the district is bound up with
that of the old kings and nobles. Foinica was originally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
a royal domain, and this monastery of the ‘Holy Spirit’
(Svéta Duša) in all probability owes its origin to the
piety of the kings, whose usual residence, Sutiska, was
not far off. From the royal race of the Tvartkos it passed
to one of the noblest of the noble families whose shields
we have been surveying; to that, namely, of Mergnjavić,
they of the <i>Vila</i> crest. The hereditary possessions of
this house lay at Naissus (Nissa) in Serbia; and coming
from the birthplace of Constantine they modestly traced
their descent from the fourth king of Rome! After the
Turkish conquest of Bosnia, some members of the family
fled, or, as they doubtless put it to themselves, <i>returned</i>,
to the Eternal City. Here one of its scions, a certain
John Tomko, published in 1632 the family archives—‘The
Proofs of the Antiquity and Nobility of the <i>Marcian</i>
Family, vulgarly known as Marnavić.’<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> Thus we possess,
in Latin translations, some of the original deeds by which
Foinica was given and confirmed to this <i>Marcia gens</i>;
and as they are, I suppose, the only documents of the
kind relating to Bosnia which have been preserved, I
may be permitted to allude to them.</p>

<p>The first grant is by King Stephen Dabiscia, otherwise
known as Tvartko II., to Goiko Mergnjavić. ‘Seeing
that when Bajazet with the Turks came and stood in
Naglasinci,’<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> and destroyed Bosnia, then came Goiko
Mergnjavić and helped us to slay the Turks. And I, King
Dabiscia, was with all the province of Bosnia, and with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
the Bosnians; and I acted in full council with all the
province of the Bosnian realm, and gave and presented
and confirmed to Goiko Mergnjavić, Foinica, and the
plain of Godalie in the territory of Imoteschi, both to
him and his heirs, and his latest posterity for ever.
Amen.’<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> The original of this was in the old Cyrillian or
Illyrian characters and in the Bosnian tongue.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p>This grant appears to have been renewed or confirmed
to another Mergnjavić, in consideration of services
equally distinguished, by King Tvartko III. The
second grant, like the other, originally written in the
native language, runs as follows:—</p>

<p>‘We, Stephen Tvartko Tvartkoević, King of Serbia,
Bosnia, Primorie, Dalmatia, of the Western part of Lower
Croatia, of Ussora, Sala, Podrinia, &amp;c., with the consent
of the realm, and according to the custom of the magnates
of every grade, to the Prince John Mergnjavić, of
Nissa, for the faithful services he rendered us in our need,
when Murat (Amurath), the Turkish Czar, was wroth
with us and wasted our dominions; for that then the said
John Mergnjavić of Nissa went to the Porte, not sparing
his own head for our sake, and found grace for us before
the Czar, and rid our realm from his host: we, therefore,
grant to him his own portion at Nissa, and Zvornik, and
Nissava, and in the realm of Bosnia the country of Foinica,<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
and the land under Thum. And it is our will that
this be not taken away from him for any breach of
fealty which shall not first have been examined by the
Bosnians and the Bosnian Church.’ As witnesses appear
the Starosts (elders) of the kingdom, the Palatine with
his brothers, the Župan Drina Driničić, the other palatines
and Princes, and the Aulic marshal of the court.
The whole is ‘written by the scribe Radoslav, Aulic of
the great and glorious lord King Tvartko, in his residential
seat of Sutiska, in the year 1426.’</p>

<p>To this was appended the great seal of King Tvartko,
attached by red silk: on one side appeared the king
seated on the throne of majesty crowned and sceptred;
on the other as a knight on horseback, holding shield
and lance.</p>

<p>When in 1448 the great Hungarian general, John
Hunyadi, defeated by Sultan Amurath on the ill-omened
field of Kóssovo, was seized in his flight by George,
Despot of Serbia, and imprisoned in the fortress of
Semendria, he owed his deliverance to another scion of
the race, George Mergnjavić, perpetual Count of Zvornik
and lord of Foinica, who hurried to his relief with a
strong body of troops collected from his territories; and
a deed in which Hunyadi confirms this George in his
possession bears witness to his gratitude. George Mergnjavić
is succeeded by his nephew Tomko, who, besides
being lord of Foinica, appears in the deed in which
Hunyadi and Ladislaus, king of Hungary, confirm his
titles, to be ‘Chief Voivode of the Kingdom of Bosnia.’
The last donation to the ‘Marcian’ family is from Mathias
Corvinus, who in 1460, six years after the overthrow of
the Bosnian kingdom by the Turks, confirms to Tomko<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
Mergnjavić, Magnificent Count of Zvornik, lord of Foinica,
and Starost of the kingdom of Rascia, his ‘mills,
mines, vineyards, fishpools, and weirs’ (aquarum decursus),
of which the Ban of Slavonia was attempting to
deprive him.</p>

<p>But we must attend to the lords of modern Foinica!
A Zaptieh brings a message from the Kaïmakàm to say
that he and the Kadi are about to drive to Kisseljak, our
own destination, and to offer us a lift in one of their
carriages; so, being for many reasons anxious to push
on, we declined the pressing invitation of the monks to
dine and pass the night with them, and descending once
more to the village found an arabà waiting for us outside
a Han, where we had ordered some eatables. The
arabà—an ordinary country waggon, only provided with
a better harness—belonged to the Kadi, but the Kaïmakàm
had taken him into his carriage—a more sumptuous
equipage—in order to provide room for us. We started
therefore under good auspices, these two functionaries
acting as our vanguard. Nor did the courtesy of the
Turks stop here, for they had given our driver a supply
of rosy apples and a sweet red-fleshed melon wherewith
to serve us at intervals during the drive. About half-way
down the Foinica valley our cortége stopped at a
little roadside Han, where the Kaïmakàm motioned us to
sit down by him on an open-air divan, canopied by
shady branches and overhanging the stream; and while
he treated us to coffee and water-melon both he and our
Kadi reaped a quiet enjoyment by extending their hospitality
to some fishes below.</p>

<p>The pebbles in the bed of the stream are stained of
a rich brown and orange with the iron ore in which the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
valley abounds. On the flanks of the mountains, on
either side, might here and there be detected huge scars
and traces of old excavations. These are the mines of
gold and silver worked of old by the Romans, and later
on by the Ragusans, but now untouched. We are in
the very midst of the mineral treasury of Bosnia. This
vale of Foinica contains, besides these precious metals,
lead ore, arsenic, quarries (unworked) of slate; and in a
tributary gorge which we had seen running south-east,
cinnabar, rich in quicksilver.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> A little lower down, just
where the Foinica stream runs into the Lepenica, the valley
opened out considerably and formed an alluvial plain.
Here and there among the stunted vegetation a column
of blue smoke marked out a rude forge, where a little
iron, the only metal exploited, is smelted to be converted
into shovels, horse-shoes, and sundry tools and weapons
for Bosnian home consumption. A few miles further
down the Lepenica debouches into the valley of the
Bosna, which is described as one vast coal-field.</p>

<p>Were we, one kept asking oneself, passing through
what some day may become one of the Black Countries
of Europe? Would, as the world grew older, something
of the tremendous energy of our Midlands burst forth
upon this stagnant valley—blasting, boring, blackening,
metamorphosing its every feature? Mountains rose around
us overgrown with primeval forest—habitations were
few and far between. What there were, were miserable
hovels—each in its mangy patch of maize—more ruinous
than any we remembered having seen in Bosnia. It was
hard to transform such into the busy streets of a great
city—the silence of the woods seemed too inveterate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
to be ever broken by the crash of a steam-hammer.
The hornpipe performed by our waggon, over what the
Turks were pleased to call a road, was a positive relief to
such desolation; and yet what stretch of imagination
could convert it into an iron-way, or our ambling Bosnian
pony into a locomotive? We seemed, however, to detect
one little omen of the future, and accepted the augury:
at one spot the foliage of some neighbouring beech-trees
had been browned away prematurely by the fumes of a
primitive forge.</p>

<p>And why, it will reasonably be asked, is all this
mineral wealth allowed to rust in the bosom of mother
earth? Are there not miners in plenty who go further
afield than Bosnia in search for precious metals? Yes.
But in Australia, even in California, there is something
like civilized government. There are railways—there
are roads; those in authority do not look upon the successful
digger as their natural prey. They are, at any
rate, too canny to kill the goose with the golden egg.</p>

<p>But here, not only are there natural obstacles serious
in any country, but before any mining can be set on foot
a long stretch of road must first be made, to be kept up
at the expense of the projectors; add to this, that even
when an avenue to one of the highways of the country
is thus opened out, it will probably be found impossible
to conduct traffic of any magnitude along them; and that
there is scarcely a bridge in the country which would
support the weight of a heavy load of ores.</p>

<p>But even were these obstacles overcome, there are
others of a political nature fatal at the very outset to
such enterprises. To take a single instance. Over the
hills to the south-east of Foinica, near the Franciscan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
monastery of Kreševo, are veins of cinnabar and quicksilver,
which have been estimated to be as rich as any
in Europe. So rich in fact are they, that a German
company were tempted to believe that, despite the expenses
of preliminary road-making and outlay of another
kind, it might pay to work them. But a concession must
first be obtained at Stamboul, and nothing can be obtained
at that sink of all human corruption without
copious bribery. The company began in good spirits;
they made first one ‘present’ and then another; but
months passed, the demands of the Sultan’s ‘advisers’
grew more and more exorbitant, and the prospect of
obtaining the required permission more remote, till,
seeing themselves in a fair way to be ruined before they
could begin, they gave up their enterprise as hopeless.
Precisely the same causes have prevented the working of
the vast coal measures of the Bosna!</p>

<p>There is one remarkable phenomenon in connection
with these ore-bearing districts, which must strike anyone
who examines the distribution of population in Bosnia;
and that is, that these former centres of mining
activity are at the present day the strongholds of the
Roman Catholic population of the country.</p>

<p>Can it be merely accidental that three of the chief
Roman Catholic monasteries in the country—Foinica,
Kreševo, and Sutiska—are each placed in the very focus
of the richest mineral areas in the province?<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span></p>

<p>No, surely, it is not fortuitous. It is rather the result
of a chain of causes, reaching far back into the past,
and which, if I read them rightly, are explanatory of
much that is most characteristic and least intelligible in
Bosnian history. Stated baldly, I cannot doubt that the
presence of the Catholic population and their monastic
seats in the mining districts of Bosnia is ultimately due
to the Roman conquest, or—if we may single out a man—to
Q. Asinius Pollio.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There seems no good reason for doubting that many of
these deserted mines, such as those that scar the mountain
sides about Foinica, were the work of Roman miners.
A Roman road, for example, has been traced almost to
the western foot of this range, connecting it with Dalmatia.
In the time of the Romans no less than 50 lbs.
of gold was turned out daily by these Illyrian miners, and
despatched to Rome by the Provost of the Dalmatian
treasury<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> at Salona.</p>

<p>When the Nations possessed themselves of the Western
Empire, Epidaurus and the Dalmatian cities still continued
to be islands of pure <i>Romanity</i>; and besides their
Roman municipal institutions and their ecclesiastical connection
with Rome, these cities may also have preserved
some record of these inland deposits of precious metals,
and some knowledge of where to look for them. This,
at least, is certain, that when the Epidauran republic lived
again at Ragusa, her sons sought out the vestiges of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
older Roman mines of Illyria, and opened them out anew,
so that the former scenes of Roman industry became the
chief commercial centres in these barbarous lands. Nor
would Ragusa fail to play her allotted part of interpreter
between Rome and the southern Sclaves. It is not to be
wondered at that in these neighbourhoods Christianity
of a purely Roman character should have taken root:
and in the days of heresy this connection with Catholic
Ragusa would perpetually keep alive influences favourable
to the Church.</p>

<p>We can well understand that the superior civilization
and wealth of these mining districts would react on the
indigenous nobility. Doubtless many noble families actually
owed their position to wealth acquired from a mine
opened on their lands by these enterprising traders.
Many would naturally draw round these small civilised
centres. To this Ragusan influence I would therefore
refer, not only the peculiarly Roman Catholic character
of the population of these mining districts, but also much
of the Roman sympathies of the ruling caste. Thus it is
not only the Roman Catholic monasteries that are found
in connection with the scenes of old Ragusan activity,
but also the favourite residences of the Bosnian kings;
so that in the neighbourhood of the chief Ragusan
castle and trading settlement—called Dubrovnik, after
the Sclavonic name of the mother city—rose both the
monastery of Sutiska, and the old town of Bobovac,
where the Tvartkos once sate in majesty. They are over
the hills, to the north-east of Foinica.</p>

<p>Nor is this far-reaching concatenation of causes and
effects without its bearings on the future as well.</p>

<p>If in the course of time Bosnia should enter once<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
more into the civilised system of Europe—if these now
unused mines were to be opened out anew, it must be evident
that such an industrial development would once more
place the chief wealth, and therefore the chief influence,
in the country in the hands of the Roman Catholic
minority; in other words, in the hands of the only
portion of the inhabitants who at the present day still
treasure the memories<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> of the old Bosnian kingdom.</p>

<p>But we are entering Kisseljak, and stop at what is
unquestionably the best hotel in Bosnia, and where, for
the first time since our arrival in the country, we obtain—beds!
Kisseljak is in fact the fashionable Bosnian
Spa. Just outside our hostelry, under a kiosque, bubble
up the waters celebrated throughout the length and
breadth of the land. ‘In taste,’ as L⸺ remarked, ‘it is
like flat seltzer-water with a <i>soupçon</i> of flat-irons.’ Mixed,
however, with red coinica wine, it becomes a livelier, and,
as we thought, a very agreeable beverage. It is said to
be very good for complaints of stomach and liver; and
quite a colony had collected in the neighbourhood of the
sources, not only to drink the waters, but to bathe in
them—certain sheds containing wooden baths being built
for the latter purpose. The wealthier people, who were
chiefly Spanish-speaking Jews from Serajevo, were lodged
at the almost European hotels; the other ranks of society
sheltering themselves, according to their means, in humbler
abodes, and the poorest, of all camping about the
valley like gipsies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span></p>

<p>It was while drinking the waters that we first became
the recipients of tidings which, in our then position,
might be considered somewhat sensational, which were
calculated to cast a new light on some of our recent
experiences, and which may fitly open a new chapter of
our pilgrimage.</p>

<p>While we were engaged in quaffing the sparkling draughts
of nature under the kiosque, up came a young Hungarian,
and asked us whether we had heard the news. On our
confessing ignorance, he informed us that a revolution
had broken out in Bosnia—or rather several dozens of
them; that a rising of rayahs had taken place near
Banjaluka, and along the Save; and that this had been
followed by a counter-rising in the Mahometan towns
and villages—and that especially the district about Dervent,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
through which we had passed, was plunged in civil
war. Vague rumours of other outbreaks at Tašlidzje,
Priepolje, and near Novipazar, had just come in; and,
from the localities of the risings, both in north and south,
this much was certain, that if the insurgents were successful,
the only highways connecting Bosnia with the
rest of Turkey and the Save provinces of Austria were
cut off; while, from the sudden departure of the Pashà
of Bosnia for the Herzegovina, it seemed not unlikely
that communication with Dalmatia was equally threatened.
But for details we had to wait till we reached
the capital, though we found the Hungarian’s account
trustworthy so far as it went.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 21.</i>—From the same informant I learnt that in a
copse near here were some monuments, locally known as
the ‘Roman Stones,’ to the investigation of which I devoted
the morning grey before we started for Serajevo.
The stones proved to be of the same character as those
already described at Podove—of the usual tea-caddy
shape—uninscribed, and even more devoid of ornament
than those we had seen before. There were several of
them scattered among the brushwood on a slight rise of
the ground.</p>

<p>In the first part of our journey to Serajevo there was
little remarkable. As we ascended the pass between the
Kobilaglava and Bulalovic ranges, we noticed the forest
cut away for a hundred yards or so on either side of the
high road; this was done for the safety of travellers,
these mountains having formerly been a nest of robbers.
The same precaution used to be taken in England in the
good old days. In the Statute of Winchester, Edward I.
devotes a whole clause to enjoining the ‘abatement’ of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
the cover by the side of the highways: ‘It is commanded
that highways leading from one market town
to another shall be enlarged wheresoever bushes, woods,
or dykes be, so that there be neither dyke, tree, nor
bush whereby a man may lurk to do hurt, within two
hundred foot of the one side, and two hundred foot of
the other side of the way; so that this statute shall not
extend unto oaks nor unto great trees, so that it shall be
clear underneath. And if by default of the lord that will
not abate the dykes, underwood, or bushes, any robberies
be done therein, the lord shall be answerable for the
felony; and if murder be done, the lord shall make a fine
at the king’s pleasure.’<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> The traveller in Bosnia is still
in the Middle Ages!</p>

<p>Having gained the summit of the mountain saddle,
we began to descend towards the Serajevsko Polje—the
Plain of Serajevo—a level expanse shut in on every side
by mountains, and looking like the former bed of a large
lake. The Alpine amphitheatre was exquisite. One peak,
loftier than the rest, had been girdled by a silvery
sea of mist, above which loomed its limestone upper
nakedness, draped in a Coan veil of aërial azure—the
island of a mirage, or one of those barren-beautiful
<i>Scoglie</i> that start ever and anon from the slumbering
bosom of the Adriatic! The heat was suffocating, and a
sultry haze seemed to flood the whole surface of the plain
and lower mountain-flanks, volatilizing every object in
an atmosphere half dusty, half lurid; and, with the faint,
languid tints of the surrounding heights, recalling to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
memory pictures of Eastern scenery—but nothing within
our own experience.</p>

<figure class="figleft illowp53" id="illus38" style="max-width: 15.625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus38.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Bas-relief of Cupid.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Near the spot where this fine panorama first opened out
we came to a small roadside Han, called Blazui, where
we obtained welcome refreshments in the shape of coffee
and boiled eggs; a little bread we had luckily brought
with us. While waiting for these delicacies, we passed
our time in closely examining some old stone blocks which
formed the basement of the wooden buildings about, in
hopes of finding perchance a Roman inscription or some
other relic of antiquity. Our desires were presently gratified
almost beyond expectation by the discovery of a
Roman monument walled into an old stone cistern, which
acted as sub-structure for a hen-roost.
It was a bas-relief of
Cupid, standing, apparently, on
a foliated capital, cross-legged,
and leaning on a torch, which
he is thus extinguishing. It has
suffered, as can be seen in the
rough sketch opposite, from the
iconoclasm of ages, Christian
and Mahometan; yet a tutored
eye could still trace the elegant
outlines. A severe critic might
condemn the art; but, though
falling short of Hellenic purity,
it was such as these benighted midlands of Illyria
have not seen the like of since the days when this
was sculptured. But the delicacy of the conception
allows us to overlook the execution. The monument is
sepulchral, of a kind not uncommon among the Romans,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
but chiefly raised to the memory of those who passed
away in the youth and vigour of their days.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> The
thoughts are turned from the unknown and the ghastly
to the memory of the beautiful and the known. <i>Vixit</i>—he
has lived. The torch of festal trippings has become the
staff for his repose: the light of love is put out: the
great darkness is upon him: <i>nox est perpetua una dormienda</i>.
It may foreshadow annihilation, but, at least,
it calls up no bony phantoms of corruption. This mutilated,
one-winged genius is indeed the emanation of ages
of refinement, set forth by the most exquisite symbolism
of ancient art. Here, truly, amidst dull and barbarous
lands, was roadside refection, spiritually, not less refreshing
than were the fragrant cups of mocha to those
parched by a well-nigh Arabian sun!</p>

<p>It does not seem that any Roman remains had been
discovered in this immediate neighbourhood before,<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
though the appearance of some of the other blocks of
masonry made it probable that this was not the only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
classic monument concealed in the foundations of the
Mahometan Han and its out-buildings. One would, indeed,
expect to find Roman remains in this vicinity, not
holy from the fact that in the neighbouring mountains
about Foinica, and again to the east about Vareš, are
traces of Roman gold-mines, and that a Roman road has
been traced tending from Salona towards these centres
of mineral wealth; but for another and still more cogent
reason. This is the presence of hot-springs, which we
passed to the right of us only a little way further on the
road, at a place called Illidzje. The Romans, with their
usual instincts, tracked out these natural baths among
the Illyrian wilds; and Roman remains in Bosnia, when
not connected with mining enterprise, seem especially
to centre round such spas. At Novipazar,<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> in the province
of Rascia, the sulphur springs still bubble up into an
octagonal marble basin near eight yards in diameter,
described as of Roman workmanship, and are still sheltered
from the elements by an octagonal chamber, supporting
a cupola, which also dates from the days of the
Cæsars. At Banjaluka<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a> on the Verbas the hot-springs
are still housed in a similar edifice; and the curious may
survey modern Mahometans taking their enjoyment in
one of these very baths which have supplied the prototype
of the early Christian baptistery. The name of
Banjaluka<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> itself preserves a Roman element, <i>Banja</i> being
no other than the Latin <i>balnea</i>. The Sclavonic settlers
borrowed the word from the earlier Roman population
of these lands—thus witnessing to the purely Roman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
associations of such spas; and so completely has the word
passed into their language that <i>Banja</i> at the present day
is applied by the Southern Sclaves to all hot-springs and
baths. But though not necessarily, therefore, proof positive
of a Roman connection, this derivative, when applied
to local names, may perhaps afford presumptive evidence
that the virtues of such spots were not unknown to the
Romans. It is at least worth noticing that the thermal
springs at Illidzje, not far from the place where we found
the bas-relief of Cupid, are still known to the Bosniacs as
‘Banja.’</p>

<p>We now descended into the plain, passing the sources
of the Bosna, not far distant, on our left. The river from
which this whole country derives its name takes its origin
from a number of small streams which, gushing forth
from the limestone slope of Mt. Igman, unite almost immediately
to form a full-volumed river of crystal purity,
some fifty yards in breadth—an Illyrian Timavus. We
crossed this new-born river by a wooden bridge of a
form, if possible, more Roman than ordinary, and nearing
the capital descried several country houses of Turkish
dignitaries, embosomed in their shady gardens. Once or
twice we met arabàs of state containing Mahometan
ladies, screened from the vulgar gaze by a brilliant scarlet
canopy supported by four posts; but feminine curiosity
prompted them to lift up the corners of the drapery
that they might observe the Giaour; and we should have
seen more of their faces had they not been veiled as well
as curtained!</p>

<p>But a turn in the road reveals to us the Damascus
of the North—for such is the majestic title by which the
Bosniac Turks, who consider it, after Stamboul, the finest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
city in Turkey-in-Europe, delight to style Serajevo. Seen,
indeed, from above, in an atmosphere which the Bosniac
historian has not inaptly compared to that of Misr and
Sham,<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> it might well call up the pearl and emerald settings
of Oriental imagery.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> The city is a vast garden,
from amidst whose foliage swell the domes and cupolas
of mosques and baths; loftier still, rises the new Serbian
Cathedral; and lancing upwards, as to tourney with the
sky, near a hundred minarets. The airy height to the
East, sceptred with these slender spires of Islâm and
turret-crowned with the Turkish fortress (raised originally
by the first Vizier of Bosnia on the site of the older
‘Grad’ of Bosnian princes), commands the rest of the
city, and marks the domination of the infidel. Around
it clusters the upper-town, populated exclusively by the
ruling caste; but the bulk of the city occupies a narrow
flat amidst the hills, cut in twain by the little river
Miljaška, and united by three stone and four wooden
bridges. Around this arena, tier above tier—at first
wooded hills, then rugged limestone precipices—rises a
splendid amphitheatre of mountains culminating in the
peak of Trebović, which frowns over 3,000 feet above the
city—herself near 1,800 above sea-level.</p>

<p>The first beginnings of Serajevo, or Bosna as it was
formerly called, are said to have been due to the mining
enterprise of the Ragusans in the neighbouring mountains;<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a>
but though in 1236 (after the destruction of
Mileševo by the Patarenes) it was made the seat of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
Roman Catholic bishops, it appears to have been little
more than a stronghold till the year 1463, when it finally
fell into the possession of the Turks. It was in the year
succeeding this event that the present town was founded
by the two Bosnian magnates, Sokolović, and Zlatarović,
who claim the doubtful honour of having been the first of
the native nobility to renegade to Islâm; and the Serai on
the hill was shortly after erected, and the upper town
walled, by Khosrev Pashà, first Vizier of Bosnia. It was
from this Serai or fortress that the town began to be
called Bosna Serai, and finally, by the Sclaves, Serajevo.
That it early attained to some majesty is shown by the fact
that it was given by Grand Signiors as a dowry to widowed
Sultanas; and early in the sixteenth century our English
traveller, Blunt, though he describes it as ‘but meanely
built and not great,’ yet reckons here ‘about four-score
Mescheetoes and twenty thousand houses.’<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> When Prince
Eugene, during his twenty days’ dash into Bosnia in
1697, penetrated to the capital, he found the upper town
so strong that, despairing of reducing it by a siege with
the small means at his disposal, he contented himself
with burning the lower town, and rode back to the Save.
His chroniclers estimate the population of Serajevo at
30,000, and set down the houses and mosques then destroyed
by the Imperialists as six thousand and a hundred
and fifty respectively.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> In the middle of the next century
the monks who supplied the author of ‘Illyricum Sacrum’
with an account of ‘the present state of Bosnia,’ speak of
the Serai as being, though a decayed city, the ‘seat of
Turkish commerce and the most renowned staple of the
realm.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span></p>

<p>Serajevo early became the head-quarters of the Bosnian
Janissaries. That in the seventeenth century it was
hardly an eligible place for a Giaour to find himself in,
may be gathered from our English traveller’s relation.
Blunt is setting out for ‘Saraih,’ as he calls the city,
‘with the Bashaw of Bosnah, his troopes going for the
warre of Poland,’ and his account gives a very pretty
picture of the military turbulence that must then have
reigned within the walls. The soldiers, it appears, were
‘spirited many with drinke, discontent, and insolency:
which made them fitter companie for the Divell then for
a Christian; my selfe after many launces, and knives
threatned upon me, was invaded by a drunken Janizary,
whose iron Mace entangled in his other furniture gave
mee time to flee among the Rocks, whereby I escaped
untoucht.’</p>

<p>But the Janissaries who ruled the roast at the Serai
were something more than a turbulent rabble of bravoes.
They were Sclaves, descendants, most, of the ruling
families of the older Bosnian kingdom. They spoke the
native tongue. They were imbued with provincial patriotism.
They were in close alliance with the haughty
provincial aristocracy, who perpetuated feudalism under
a Mahometan guise. These Sclavonic Janissaries refused
to take to the celibacy and barrack-life of their order.
They took wives. They became landed proprietors. They
even settled down to mercantile pursuits. Thus, with
their participation and patronage, Bosna Serai, the chosen
seat of the Bosnian nobility, the Camp of her Prætorians,
acquired rights and immunities which made her a Free
City.</p>

<p>Nothing in this curious history is more interesting to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
observe than the way in which the primitive institutions
of Sclavonic family life assert themselves in this municipal
constitution. The Civic Communism—I use the word in
its uncorrupted sense—grows out of the domestic. Just as
the Bosnian family communities elected, and still elect,
their elders, so now the families who owned the surrounding
lands were represented by a hereditary <i>Starešina</i>; and
the artisans and merchants bound themselves into <i>Bratsva</i>
or brotherhoods, each guild electing its <i>Starost</i> or alderman.
Thus arose a civic government, based on the possession
of real property and prosperity in trade.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p>Enjoying such a municipal constitution, actively protected
by the Janissaries at Stamboul, the Serai rose to
an almost sovereign position in Bosnia. So jealous was
its senate of its privileges, and so irresistible its authority,
that it actually established a municipal law by which the
Vizier of Bosnia was forbidden to tarry more than a day
at a time within the city walls. For a single night he was
entertained at the public expense; next morning he was
escorted without the gates. Even in the exercise of his
shadowy authority at Travnik, the Sultan’s lieutenant
stood in perpetual fear of the patriarchs of the real
capital; for if he presumed to offend these haughty
elders, they had but to lodge a complaint against him
with the Odjak of the Janissaries at Stamboul, and the
Vizier was forthwith recalled. The Porte, indeed, endeavoured
to assert its sovereignty within the city by
appointing two officers to decide disputes between Moslems
and Rayahs, but the citizens retained the right of
dismissing these at their pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span></p>

<p>Thus Serajevo was the mouthpiece of the old Sclavonic
national feeling of Bosnia, as it survived in a
Mahometan guise—the acknowledged protectress of provincial
interests against the hated Osmanlì. Bosnia had
changed her creed, but she clung to her independence;
and when, at the beginning of the present century, Sultan
Mahmoud II. thought to stamp out provincial liberties in
Bosnia as elsewhere, it was the Serai that took the lead
in opposition. When the Janissaries were extinguished at
Stamboul, their tall ovoid turbans, the gold and imperial
green, still flaunted themselves unchallenged in the streets
of Serajevo. The citadel on the height was their last refuge.
It was, however, successfully stormed by the Vizier, and
Serajevo was given over to the tender mercies of the
Sultan’s officer. A terrible vengeance was wreaked,
and more than a hundred of the leading citizens were
proscribed and executed. The Vizier took up his residence
triumphantly in the fortress, but the reign of the
Osmanlì lasted only a few months. In July 1828 the
citizens of Serajevo, aided by those of Visoko, rose
desperately against the oppressor. A street fight followed,
which lasted three days. The Vizier, who upheld
his authority with a garrison near 2,000 strong, made an
obstinate resistance, but the imperial troops were gradually
beaten back from house to house, from mosque to
mosque, till, fairly overmastered, the Sultan’s lieutenant
was glad to escape with his life and the shattered remnant
of his troops. A few years later Serajevo again
fell into the hands of the destroyer of the Janissaries.
But in the Bosnian rebellion of 1850 the citizens once
more flew to arms. For a while they made themselves
masters of the Vizier’s fortress on the height, but finally<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
succumbed to Ali Pashà; and the municipal independence
of Serajevo shared the ruin of feudalism throughout
Bosnia. The true capital of Bosnia has since been the
seat of the Turkish Governor of the Vilajet.</p>

<p>But though Serajevo herself has degenerated into the
<i>chef-lieu</i> of a ‘circle’—though an alien bureaucracy has
succeeded the patriarchal sway of her own landowners
and merchants—though Giaour-Sultans and ‘New Turks’
from Stamboul—those muck-rakes of mendicant statecraft
who filch their political tinsel from the gutters of
the boulevards!—have replaced her native Agas and elders
by an Osmanlì ‘<i>Préfet</i>,’ with the same apish levity with
which these same gentry toss aside the jewelled amber
of their forefathers for a Parisian cigarette!—nevertheless,
despite of all these tinkering experiments in centralization
of which they have been made the <i>corpus vile</i>, the
citizens of this old stronghold of provincial liberties have
only clung with warmer attachment to the ‘true green’ of
Bosnian Toryism. Only what they can no longer practise
in politics they parade in religion, and Serajevo remains
more than ever the focus of the Mahometan fanaticism of
Bosnia. This was the danger of the present moment, and
gave but too valid grounds for the wide-spread apprehension
among the Bosnian rayahs that the outbreak of
the revolt might provoke the bigots of the capital to a
general massacre of the Christian minority there; and
that the Damascus of the North might, as she had already
threatened a year or two ago on a less provocation, reproduce
the bloody scenes which have made her Syrian
namesake a word of terror to the Christians of Turkey.</p>

<p>This is what happened here only three years ago, as
we heard the story from those who played a distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
part in averting the impending catastrophe; nor can anything
give a better idea of the dangerous spirit abroad
among the Moslem population of Serajevo.</p>

<p>The new orthodox cathedral, which now forms the
most prominent object in the city, was begun a few years
ago by the Serb or Greek Church here, on a scale which
seemed to make it a direct challenge to the Mahometan
part of the population. The presence of the consular
body in the town made it possible for the Christians to
take advantage of the right of church-building accorded
by Firmans of the Grand Signior, and accordingly the
work proceeded without any interference. But the
Christians were not content with the permission to build
a church in the most conspicuous position in one of the
main streets of the city, but must needs rear a pretentious
pile which should throw into the shade the biggest
of the two hundred and odd mosques with which
Mahometan piety has adorned the Serai. No expense
was spared, and the total outlay reached, so we were
credibly informed, the (for this country) enormous sum
of £13,000, exclusive of the costly icons and other
church-furniture presented by the Emperor of Russia.
A swaggering edifice—all of stone—built in the usual
bastard Byzantine taste of the Fanariote hierarchy, and
of which the worst that can be said is that it is worthy
of its patrons—began to raise itself above the neighbouring
house-tops, and at last contemptuously looked down
on the dome of the Imperial Mosque itself—the Dzàmia
of Sultan Mahommed! It was perhaps hardly to be
expected that the ignorant Moslem fanatics should view
with equanimity this last manifestation of Christian
humility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span></p>

<p>What, however, seems especially to have stuck in
their throats, was the design of hanging bells in the
cathedral tower. It is strange the animosity which such
an apparently harmless sound as that of a church bell
has always excited in the bosoms of those hostile to the
Christian faith. Those of us who have Norse blood running
in their veins may remember that their heathen
ancestors showed just the same vehement repugnance
to the tintinnabulation of too officious missionaries.
Perhaps in a Mahometan country it may be feared by
the faithful that the infidel clangour might drown the
prayers of the muezzin on neighbouring minarets; perhaps
the renegade population of Bosnia have inherited
something of the prejudice that led their Bogomilian forefathers
to regard Church bells as ‘Devil’s trumpets’! But
this, at least, is certain, that in Bosnia there are few
Christian churches where any other summons to the congregation
is allowed than that of a wooden clapper; and
that to hang bells in a centre of Moslem fanaticism like
Serajevo was a deliberate and wanton provocation.</p>

<p>The plain English of the matter is that the Christians
of Serajevo, relying on consular protection, saw in the
erection of this new church a fine opportunity for wiping
off the scores of ancient insults against the Mahometans.
It was quite natural that they should do so. But
it was also natural that the Moslems should refuse to
pocket the insult. The ringleaders of fanaticism in the
city took up the gauntlet thus thrown down, and some
time before the day of the opening ceremony it oozed
out that a Mahometan conspiracy was afoot by which
short work would be made of the unbelievers and their
conventicle together. The indefinite multiplication of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
evil passions caused by ecclesiastical wrong-headedness
had brought matters to such a pass, that Easter Day—the
date of the opening ceremony—might have proved a
second St. Bartholomew’s for the Christian minority of
Serajevo.</p>

<p>Happily, at this crisis, the consular body stepped in.
Mr. Holmes, our representative—who took a prominent
and worthy part in averting the bloodshed—and the other
Consuls, informed the Pashà of the imminence of the
danger, and unfolded to him the existence of a Mahometan
conspiracy. The Pashà sent some of the ringleaders
out of the country, made the leading Moslems responsible
for the preservation of order, and finally persuaded
the Christians to forego the bell-ringing. As it was, the
opening ceremony took place under the protection of
Turkish arms. The city was placed in a state of siege.
For three days previously all the wine-shops in the town
had been closed by order of the authorities. The troops
were held in barracks under arms. At intervals along
the streets trumpeters were stationed to give the earliest
alarm; and, in fine, such precautions were taken as prevented
any actual disturbance of the peace.</p>

<p>It was not without some vague misgivings that we
now found ourselves entering the streets of this metropolis
of fanaticism. But the sight which presently broke
on us, on turning a corner into the main street, was such
as might well convince us that the worst forebodings of the
Bosnian Christians had come true. We had emerged on
the scene of a great fire which had destroyed one entire
side of the street, so that we were obliged to pick our
way among black and smouldering <i>débris</i>, through which
a party of Turks were engaged in clearing a path. They,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
however, seemed peaceable enough, and we were further
relieved by seeing the cupola of the Serbian cathedral
rising unscathed on the other side of the way.</p>

<p>We presently met a consular Cavass, who politely
conducted us to the English Consulate, situate on the
other side of the little river Miljaška, which we crossed
by a stone bridge. Our Consul was away, having migrated
to Mostar in order to be nearer the centre of the
disturbances in the Herzegovina; but we were hospitably
taken in by his amiable daughters, and Mr. Freeman, his
<i>chargé d’affaires</i>; and found ourselves, after our long
course of roughing, once more among the comforts of an
English home, and surrounded by the quiet of an English
garden. Here, in this rich soil, under this Eastern
sky, we saw for the first time in Bosnia our familiar
flowers—roses, verbenas, and petunias, and others equally
delicious—scenting the air, and making us realise what
a paradise this land might become in civilized hands.
The fruit-trees—the stock of which Mr. Holmes, who has
great horticultural taste, had imported from Malta—were
weighed down with an exuberant crop of plums, peaches,
greengages, and apples, each of which would have secured
a prize at a show; and this though from the shallowness
of the soil these trees only flourish for a time.
Contrast with these the miserable plums, pears, and
apples obtainable in the native markets of Serajevo!
The Bosniacs show themselves absolutely incapable of
pomiculture; they plant their fruit-trees almost as close
together as cabbages, and expect them to thrive. Our
Consul produced magnificent peaches by simply planting
the miserable Bosnian substitute properly.</p>

<p>We found that affairs here had taken a very serious<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
turn. On Saturday last Dervish Pashà, the Vali or
Governor-General of Bosnia, had left to take the command
in Herzegovina, where the revolt was making head.
On Sunday—this country being now left without any
competent head—the revolt broke out in Bosnia. The
news, as may be imagined, produced great excitement
here, and threw the Christian minority into a state verging
on consternation. The old rumours of an approaching
massacre once more gained credence. But the panic
became universal last night, when flames were observed
rising from the immediate neighbourhood of the new
cathedral, and in the centre of the Christian quarter,
amongst houses inhabited by the leading Christian
merchants. The Governor, Hussein Pashà, by repute
a weak and incapable man, hearing the guns and
cannon—which are here the usual fire-signals—and
seeing the conflagration, at once jumped to the conclusion
that the anticipated outbreak was beginning; and
instead of sending the troops—who in Serajevo supply
the place of a fire-brigade—to put out the fire, kept
them in barracks waiting for the light to reveal the
supposed disturbers of the peace. Thus the fire—which
in its origin was, as we learnt from the most authentic
source, purely accidental, and so far from being the work
of a Moslem fanatic, had actually originated in the house
of a well-known Mahometan, a renegade detested by the
Christians—was allowed to spread, and fifteen houses in
the most flourishing quarter of Serajevo were reduced to
ashes before the Pashà could be undeceived, or proper
measures be taken to bring the flames under. The danger
to the whole city was imminent, the houses being mostly
of wood and plaster; and, indeed, Serajevo had been previously<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
burnt down on four several occasions. Perhaps
the motives which induced the Mahometans to lend active
help to the Christians in conquering the flames were not
altogether disinterested.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, from the unfortunate quarter in which
the conflagration had arisen, and from the electric state
of the political atmosphere, it lay in the very nature of
things that the origin of the disaster should be misrepresented,
and that the majority of the Christian population
took it for granted that it was the work of Moslem
spite. Thus a purely accidental circumstance had added
fuel to the general uneasiness, and to-day a panic prevailed
among the Christians of Serajevo.</p>

<p>From the English Consulate, where we are now
lodged, we hastened to pay our respects to two English
ladies whose acquaintance we had already had the good
fortune to make on the Save, and who are prosecuting a
work in Bosnia of which their own country may well be
proud, and for which a more civilised Bosnia may hereafter
be grateful. Some years ago Miss Irby first travelled
through many of the wildest parts of Turkey in Europe
in company with Miss Muir Mackenzie, and the book
composed by these two ladies on the Sclavonic Provinces
of Turkey is well known to all Englishmen who take an
interest in those neglected lands and their down-trodden
Sclavonic cousins. But Miss Irby, with the practical
spirit of her race, was not content with acquainting the
world with the lamentable condition of the Serbian
people under the Turkish yoke, but set herself to work
to remedy these evils. It was the backward state of
education among the rayah women of even the better<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
classes which struck her as one of the peculiar obstacles
in the way of national progress, and it was this which she
resolved to overcome. In 1865 Miss Irby settled in Serajevo,
and since that date she and a fellow-labourer, Miss
Johnston, have devoted their lives to a propaganda of
culture among the Bosnian Christian women. Nothing
in their efforts has been more conspicuous than their
good sense. As the best way to promote the spread of
a liberal education among the women, these ladies have
formed a school in which to bring up native school-mistresses.
There has been no attempt at Protestant
proselytism; the pupils, whether of the Greek or Romish
Church, being left to the spiritual charge of their own
pastors.</p>

<p>We found these ladies engaged in packing up their
effects preparatory to removing from the country for the
present with their most promising pupils. They had
only arrived the previous Thursday by the tedious post
from Brood; but the state of affairs seemed so threatening,
that there was nothing for it but to take the children
elsewhere and wait for quieter times. They experienced
some difficulty in obtaining permission from the Pashà
to take the embryo school-mistresses with them, as the
Pashà considered that their departure would increase
the panic among the Christians of Serajevo, by whom
they are widely known and respected. It could not,
however, well have been greater. Already, several of the
leading Serb merchants had presented themselves at the
English school-house, and begged to be allowed shelter
if the expected butchery commenced. The Austrian
Consul had just taken away his wife, and a general exodus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
of Christians from the city was going on. Miss
Irby<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> and Miss Johnston finally obtained the required
permission, and, as we were afterwards happy to learn,
have succeeded in planting their school at Prague till
this tyranny be overpast. It is difficult indeed for the
liberal arts to flourish at the best of times in a Turkish
province! The other day, on the opening of a rayah
school at Banjaluka, the authorities issued peremptory
orders prohibiting the teaching of history or geography!
So rigid has become the censorship of the press, that
Miss Irby, though provided, like ourselves, with an autograph
Bujuruldu from the Governor-General of Bosnia,
was not allowed to bring her little store of books into
the country, and was forced to leave them at Brood.
The state of literature in Serajevo itself may be gathered
from the following fact: in a city of between fifty and
sixty thousand inhabitants there is not a single book-shop!</p>

<p><i>Aug. 22.</i>—To-day we made the acquaintance of the
German Consul, Count Von Bothmar, who expressed
considerable surprise at our arriving here unmolested.
From him and the other members of the consular body,
who were very ready to supply us with full details as to
the stirring events that are taking place around us, we
learnt many interesting facts relative to the causes and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
course of the insurrection in Bosnia. These accounts,
and others from trustworthy sources, reveal such frantic
oppression and gross misgovernment as must be hardly
credible to Englishmen. We have heard all that can
be said on the Turkish side, but the main facts remain
unshaken.</p>

<p>The truth is that outside Serajevo and a few of the
larger towns where there are Consuls or resident ‘Europeans,’
neither the honour, property, nor the lives of
Christians are safe. Gross outrages against the person—murder
itself—can be committed in the rural districts
with impunity. The authorities are blind; and it is quite
a common thing for the gendarmes to let the perpetrator
of the grossest outrage, if a Mussulman, escape before
their eyes. There is a proverb among the Bosnian Serbs,
‘No justice for the Christian.’ Miss Irby, who has made
many enquiries on these subjects, estimates that in the
Medjliss, the only court where Christian evidence is even
legally admitted, ‘the evidence of twenty Christians
would be outweighed by two Mussulmans.’<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> But why, it
may be asked, do not the Christians appeal to the Consuls
for protection? In the first place, in a mountainous
country like Bosnia, with little means of communication,
to do so would in most cases be a physical impossibility.
In the second place, as Count Bothmar assured
us, if such complaint is made to a Consul, so surely is the
complaining rayah more cruelly oppressed than before;
henceforth he is a marked man, nor is consular authority
so omnipresent as to save him and his family
from ruin. ‘God alone knows,’ he exclaimed, ‘what<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
the rayahs suffer in the country districts!’ Remembering
the revolting scenes, of which I had been a witness, at
the Christian gathering near Comušina, I could believe
this.</p>

<p>But the most galling oppression, and the main cause
of the present revolt, is to be found in the system and
manner of taxation. The centralised government set up
in Bosnia since 1851 is so much machinery for wringing
the uttermost farthing out of the unhappy Bosniac rayah.
The desperate efforts of Turkish financiers on the eve of
national bankruptcy have at last made the burden of
taxation more than even the long-suffering Bosniac can
bear. It was the last straw.</p>

<p>The principal tax—besides the house and land tax, the
cattle tax,<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> and that paid by the ‘Christian’ in lieu of military
service which is wrung from the poorest rayah for every
male of his family down to the baby in arms<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>—is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
eighth,<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> or, as it is facetiously called by the tax-collector,
the tenth, which is levied on all produce of the earth. With
regard to the exaction of this tax, every conceivable iniquity
is practised. To begin with, its collection is farmed out to
middle-men, and these, ex-officio pitiless, are usually by
origin the scum of the Levant. The Osmanlì or the
Sclavonic Mahometan possesses a natural dignity and
self-respect which disinclines him for such dirty work.
The men who come forward and offer the highest price
for the license of extortion are more often Christians—Fanariote
Greeks—adventurers from Stamboul, members
of a race perhaps the vilest of mankind. No
considerations of honour, or religion, or humanity, restrain
these wretches. Having acquired the right to
farm the taxes of a given district, the Turkish officials
and gendarmerie are bound to support them in wringing
the uttermost farthing out of the <i>misera contribuens
plebs</i>, and it is natural that this help should be most
readily forthcoming when needed to break the resistance
of the rayah.</p>

<p>These men time their visitation well. They appear
in the villages before the harvest is gathered and assess
the value of the crops according to the present prices,
which, of course, are far higher just before the harvest
than after it. But the rayahs would be well contented
if their exactions stopped here. They possess, however,
a terrible lever for putting the screw on the miserable
tiller. The harvest may not be gathered till the tax,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
which is pitilessly levied in cash, has been extorted. If
the full amount—and they often double or treble the
legal sum—is not forthcoming, the tax-gatherer simply
has to say ‘then your harvest shall rot on the ground
till you pay it!’ And the rayah must see the produce
of his toil lost, or pay a ruinous imposition which more
than swamps his profits.</p>

<p>But supposing, as often happens, the Spahi, or tithe-farmer,
who is shrewd enough to know that <i>ex nihilo nihil
fit</i>, sees no means of wringing the required amount from
the village till after the harvest has been disposed of. In
that case he imposes on the Knez or village elder, who
represents the commune in the transaction, an assessment
drawn up in the Turkish tongue,<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> and as intelligible
to the rural Bosniac as so much Chinese. The money
from the grapes or corn or tobacco assessed having been
realised, the Spahi presents himself again to the village,
and demands, perhaps, double what had been agreed on.
The astonished Knez takes out the written agreement, a
copy of which had been supplied to him, and appeals to
it against the extortioner. But if he carries the matter
before a Turkish court, the first Effendi who sets eyes on
it will tell him that every iota of the Spahi’s claims is
borne out by that precious document!</p>

<p>Or if he still remains obstinate, there are other paraphernalia
of torture worthy of the vaults of the Inquisition.
A village will occasionally band together to defend themselves
from these extortioners. Thereupon the tithe-farmer
applies to the civil power, protesting that if he
does not get the full amount from the village, he will be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
unable in his turn to pay the Government. The Zaptiehs,
the factotums of the Turkish officials, are immediately
quartered on the villagers, and live on them, insult their
wives, and ill-treat their children. With the aid of these
gentry all kinds of personal tortures are applied to the
recalcitrant. In the heat of summer men are stripped
naked, and tied to a tree smeared over with honey or
other sweet-stuff, and left to the tender mercies of the
insect world. For winter extortion it is found convenient
to bind people to stakes and leave them barefooted
to be frost-bitten; or at other times they are
thrust into a pigsty and cold water poured on them. A
favourite plan is to drive a party of rayahs up a tree
or into a chamber, and then smoke them with green
wood. Instances are recorded of Bosniac peasants being
buried up to their heads in earth, and left to repent at
leisure.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span></p>

<p>I will quote a single instance of these practices,
communicated by the Princess Julia of Servia to the
author of ‘Servia and the Servians.’ ‘A poor woman,
frantic with agony, burst into the palace of the Princess
at Belgrade. She had been assessed by the Turkish
authorities of a village in Bosnia of a sum which she had
no means of paying.... <i>She was smoked.</i> This failed of
extracting the gold. She begged for a remission, and
stated her inability to pay. In answer she was tossed into
the river Drina, and after her were thrown her two infant
children—one of four years old, the other of two. Before
her eyes, notwithstanding her frantic efforts to save them,
her children perished. Half drowned and insensible, she
was dragged to land by a Serbian peasant. She made
her way to Belgrade, believing, from the character of
the Princess for humanity, that she would aid her. Of
course to do so was out of the question.’<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a></p>

<p>Gustav Thoemmel, who was attached to the Austrian
Consulate here, relates how the application of such tortures
drove many Bosnian rayahs to desperation in 1865.
No less than five hundred families took refuge across<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
the borders from these inquisitors in the spring of that
year. They were, however, turned back and forced to
return to their homes in Bosnia in a most deplorable
state. ‘Complaint,’ says Thoemmel, ‘about outrages of
this kind are scarcely ever brought forward, since the
rayah seldom obtains evidence or even hearing, and his
complaining only brings down on him increased persecution.
So it happens that the higher officials often remain
in entire ignorance of the barbarities perpetrated
by their underlings.’</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that the higher authorities
here are altogether blind as to the evils attendant
on the tithe-farming. It will hardly be believed that
the present Governor-General, and his predecessor Osman
Pashà, have been doing their best to remove this abuse,
but were thwarted by the authorities at Stamboul, who
have in recent years taken away much of the independent
power of the provincial Vali, the better to suck
everything into that sink of corruption. Our Consul has
for years directed his energies with the same object, and
acting on his representations, Lord Stratford de Redcliffe
used all his influence to support the appeal of Osman
Pashà. But neither our most influential ambassador
nor the Turkish Governor-General of Bosnia could induce
the Porte to remove the abuse. The pretext by which
these representations were always eluded was that the tithe
was a religious institution. The present Vali,<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> a man of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
more subtle genius, had, however, succeeded in drawing a
distinction between this and the religious tithe, and was
confident that he would be shortly permitted to abolish
it, and substitute for it a land tax not farmed by middle-men.
But it was already too late. The present revolts,
both in Bosnia and the Herzegovina, are mainly due to
the extortion of the ‘dime.’</p>

<p>It was on Sunday, August 15—the same day on
which the great Christian pilgrimage took place on the
mountain above Comušina—that the peasants of that
part of Bosnia, who had been goaded to madness during
the last few weeks by the exactions of the tax-gatherer
(with whom this year the government, itself unable to
meet its creditors, had driven a harder bargain than
usual), first took up arms. From the rapidity with
which the revolt spread through Lower Bosnia there
seems to have been a preconcerted movement—indeed,
it was previously known at Belgrade with sufficient
accuracy what lines the outbreak would follow. The
first movement took place near Banjaluka, where the
rayah villagers rose on their extortioners and slew eight
tax-gatherers. This was immediately followed by other
risings extending along the Possávina to the neighbourhood
of Brood and Dervent. Several of the watch-towers
along this frontier were surprised, and their Turkish garrison
massacred. Meanwhile, the Christian women and
children are fleeing beyond the Austrian border for protection;
the banks of the Save at the present moment are a
piteous sight, and the forest border and willow river-hedge
are crowded with these harmless fugitives, holding out
their hands and entreating to be ferried over to the Slavonian
shore. The news of the outbreak quite bewildered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
the authorities at Serajevo. The Vali, the only man
capable of coping with the difficulties of the situation,
had just left for the Herzegovina. Bosnia was bereft of
troops, for the Seraskier at Stamboul, disregarding the
earnest warnings of the Vali, had persisted in withdrawing
the regulars stationed in the province till hardly any
were left, and of these every available man, except those
absolutely necessary for garrison duty, had now been
dispatched to the Herzegovina.</p>

<p>Meantime, the Mahometan population of Lower Bosnia
has taken the law into its own hands, and the authorities
have been forced to look on and see the Mahometan
volunteers, the Bashi-Bazouks—not long ago suppressed
for conduct too outrageous for even the worst of governments
to tolerate—spring once more into existence.
Such were the ferocious warriors whose acquaintance
we had made at Travnik. To-day they are streaming
into Serajevo: we met a party of them defiling through
the street, and the leader of the gang, as he passed,
glared savagely at the Giaour. They are, from what we
hear, mere organised brigands headed by irresponsible
partizans, and at present are committing the wildest
atrocities—cutting down women, children, and old men
who come in their way, and burning the crops and homesteads
of the rayah. That the defence of Bosnia should
have fallen into the hands of such men is one of the most
terrible features of the situation, and nothing can better
show the abjectness of her present governors than that
they have now consented to accept the services of these
bandits—and that even the Turkish authorities are now
calling them out as well as the Redìf. There seems,
however, to be little authority of any sort left to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
government at the seat of the insurrection in Bosnia, for
the native Mahometan population, seeing itself left defenceless
by its Osmanlì officials, has rudely thrust them
aside, and the defensive measures are now being carried
out by self-constituted committees of public safety, which
have sprung up at Banjaluka, Dervent, and other towns.
The artificial bureaucracy of 1851 has collapsed under
the shock, and the long-restrained savagery of the old
dominant caste has burst forth like a caged lion for the
defence of Islâm. The marauding bands now desolating
Bosnia are for the most part headed by Begs or Agas,
scions of the old Bosnian nobility: the Bashi-Bazouks
are simply feudal retainers following their lords. Thus,
in Bosnia, the Christian outbreak has been opposed by a
counter-revolution of Moslem fanaticism in close alliance
with the still vital relics of Bosnian feudalism.</p>

<p>News of a sanguinary fight near Banjaluka, between
five hundred insurgents and the Turks, has just come in.
It lasted eleven hours, ‘with uncertain results’—which
means favourably to the Christians. The number of the
revolters at one spot, and the duration of the conflict,
alike witness the seriousness of the rising. The telegraph
to Brood has just been cut, but a battalion has been
dispatched to keep open the communication at this important
point. We further hear that the streets of Agram
and Belgrade are placarded with inflammatory proclamations,
calling on the Southern Sclaves to rise in defence
of their brothers. Like manifestoes have appeared at
Bucharest. The German Consul looks on this South-Sclavonic
agitation as one of the most serious features of
the present situation. As far as Serajevo is concerned,
he already telegraphed three days ago to Berlin and Constantinople<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
that there was no longer security here against
any contingency.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the events in the city seem to be shaping
their course on the model of 1872. To-day a conjuration
of about three hundred of the leading Turks took
place in the great Mosque. They appeared there with
arms in their hands, and swore that there was a plot
against their lives! It has now oozed out that they have
banded themselves together to fall with their following
on the Christians of Serajevo, should the revolt break out
any nearer here—as things go, a not unlikely contingency.
The Christians are more alarmed than ever, and
appeal to consular protection. Their apprehensions are
further excited by the fact that a notorious brigand—a
certain Dervish Aga—has appeared at the head of the
Mahometan volunteers of this neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Now, it appears that even our humble selves have
become the objects of fanatical suspicion. We have
been already honoured by having consular reports sent to
the representative of Austria regarding our motions and
conduct during our tour—which reports were the subject
of an official interview between that gentleman and our
Consul, who endeavoured to explain it to him—with
what success is doubtful—that it was not the practice of
the English Government to send political agitators on
secret missions to nationalities! It is now the turn of the
Mahometans to suspect our intentions, and a few harmless
sketches of Serajevan costumes, and a little innocent
curiosity as to the wares on some of the Serajevan shop-boards,
have excited such indignation in the bosoms of true
believers that a deputation of forty Turks waited on the
Pashà to complain of us, and entering, as it would appear,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
into a kind of competition which could display the most
Oriental inventiveness of calumny—it has resulted in our
being accused first of taking notes of the fortress, and
ultimately of violating a mosque! Of course we had
scrupulously avoided even approaching the portals of
such a sacred edifice; and as to the fortress, we had not
even visited the quarter of the town in which it stands.
Mr. Freeman convinced the Pashà that these accusations
were false; but it was thought better after this that we
should be accompanied in our peregrinations by consular
guards or cavasses, English or German.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 23rd.</i>—This morning the German Consul, with
whom we lunched, informed us that he had just obtained
an interview with the Pashà to represent to him the
threatening state of affairs, and especially this new
Mahometan conspiracy, and to ask what measures he
intended to take to protect the Christians in the event of
a disturbance. The Pashà explicitly declared that he
was ready to use his troops and cannon against the
first disturbers of the peace, to whatever party they belonged.
The Consul is tolerably satisfied with this, and
believes that the troops are sufficiently Osmanlì and
obedient to official commands to be trusted not to
fraternize with the native Mahometan fanatics.</p>

<p>We had been asked to meet the representatives of
Austria and Russia, and received quite an ovation at the
Consulate. The conversation turned on the Greek hierarchy
of this country, and the worst that we had heard
of these wolves in sheep’s clothing was more than corroborated.
Perhaps the most terrible feature of the
tyranny under which the Bosnian rayah groans, is that
those, who should protect, betray him, and that those, to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
whom he looks for spiritual comfort, wring from him the
last scrap of worldly belongings which has escaped the
rapacity of the infidel. Amongst all the populations of
modern Turkey there is only one so vile as to fawn upon
the tyrants. The modern Greeks of Constantinople—the
Fanariotes, let us call them—not to pollute a hallowed
name—have inherited all the corruption of a corrupt
empire, and added to their hereditary store. It is from
these, as we have seen, that the odious class of middle-men,
who farm the taxes, is chiefly recruited. It is also
from these that the dignitaries of the Greek Church
throughout Turkey are chosen.</p>

<p>The Turks have not hesitated to utilize the sleek
knavery ready to their beck. It has long been a part
of Turkish policy to rivet the fetters of their Sclavonic
subjects by filling the high ecclesiastical offices of the
Greek Church with Fanariote bishops. The office of the
old Serbian metropolitans who resided at Ipek was suppressed,
and Bosnia has since been divided into four
eparchies<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> under the immediate control of the Patriarch
of Constantinople, the Eparchs needing, like the head
of the Greek Church himself, an exequatur from the
infidel before they can enter on their functions. The
Greek Patriarch takes good care that these eparchies shall
be filled by none but Fanariotes, and thus it happens
that the Pravoslaves or orthodox Christians of Bosnia,
who form the majority of the population,<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> are subjected<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
to ecclesiastics, aliens in blood, in language, in sympathies,
who oppress them hand in hand with the Turkish
officials, and set them, often, an even worse example of
moral depravity.</p>

<p>It does not become the English language to record
the Sejanian arts by which they rise. Usually, as the
lackey of a Pashà or some rich Fanariote, they amass
gains which they afterwards lay out in an episcopal speculation—for
sees go to the highest bidders at Stamboul.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
The new Metropolitan arrives at Serajevo, and immediately
sets to work to make the speculation pay. To retain
their office they have further to send enormous bribes
yearly to the fountain-head of corruption. Thus the
simony which begins on the patriarchal throne descends to
the meanest pulpit, and the poorest pope in Bosnia has to
bargain with his bishop for his cure of souls! The shepherd,
fleeced himself by his bishop, must recoup himself
from his flock. On every occasion of life he levies a contribution
in money or in kind, and in some cases he has
even succeeded in establishing a system of heriots. On the
death of the father of a family he takes the best ox; on
the mother’s death, a cow. Not infrequently children grew
up unbaptized because the parents were too poor to pay
the fee required.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> As to the parsons themselves, their
ignorance is usually so gross that they cannot read the
Sclavonic liturgy, and simply repeat it by rote! The
Metropolitan of Serajevo is said to wring as much as
10,000<i>l.</i> a year from his miserable flock: the other three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
content themselves with about half that amount apiece.
When it is remembered that the salary of the Vali Pashà
himself only amounts to 500<i>l.</i> a year, the enormity of
these figures may be appreciated. These four successors
of the fishermen of Galilee extort annually between
them a sum equal to one-sixteenth of the total
income received by the government of the province
from taxation. Since, however, a large part of what
they extract from the unhappy rayahs must be transmitted
in the form of bribes to Stamboul, the Turkish
authorities have orders to assist them in levying their
exactions; and whole Christian villages share the fate of
a sacked city from Turkish gendarmerie, for refusing,
or too often being unable, to comply with the exorbitant
demands of Christian prelates.</p>

<p><i>De</i> vivis <i>nil nisi bonum</i>. The predecessor of the
present Metropolitan of Serajevo, amongst his other
accomplishments, was an habitual drunkard. He lived
in Sardanapalian luxury—his table groaned with plate;
and at his death he left untold treasures in costly furs
alone—the fleecings of his flock! His rapacity was such
that even the slavish spirit of the Bosnian rayah was
provoked to resistance, and in 1864 the agitation became
so dangerous that an assembly of the notables was called
at Serajevo to devise a remedy; and a certain standard
of ecclesiastical dues not to be transgressed was finally
imposed on the bishops by the Turkish authorities themselves.
But the Metropolitan, with the shrewdness of
his race, read between the lines. All that was meant, as
he had the good sense to perceive, was a slight increase
of his expenditure under the head of <i>lubrication</i>. Thoemmel,
writing so soon after these events as 1867, mentions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
that ‘this standard has already become a dead letter.’ It
is no secret that one of the main provocations of the revolt
in the Herzegovina was the tyranny of the Turkophile
bishop Prokopios. When the storm burst, one of the
first attempts at pacification was the translation of this
ghostly vampire to a fatter see!</p>

<p>Vain indeed must be the efforts of the rayah flock to
save themselves from the wolves while they have a
hireling for their shepherd! These episcopal sycophants
of the infidel serve the Turk in a hundred ways—they
screen a hundred abuses. No sooner does an awkward
revelation see the light, than one of these renegade prelates
steps forward to throw dust in the eyes of the
Christian West. They know well that to a certain class
of mind there is something comfortable in the very name
of bishop. They trade upon the saintly spell which
throws a halo of veracity round any lies they may invent
to shield their patrons or themselves. Ill-founded, indeed,
seem the complaints of the rayah when his bishop comes
forward to confess, from a Christian love of truth and
justice—but with how much laudable reluctance!—that
the wrongs of his too blatant flock are purely imaginary,
and that, if anyone has been aggrieved, it is the honest,
the moral, the merciful, the tolerant, Osmanlì!<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a></p>

<p>As an useful sedative we have taken a Bosnian bath,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
and found both building and ceremony deliciously Oriental.
We entered to find ourselves under a spacious dome,
pierced with a constellation of star-like openings, which
shed a dim religious light on marble pavements, and ogee
archways and niches. In the centre a fountain, playing
into a marble basin, glittered and twinkled in the artificial
starlight, and faintly echoing with a cavernous murmur
through vault and corridor, not only added a refreshing
chill to the atmosphere—cooled already by exclusion of
sunlight and the marble walls—but seemed to let in a sense
of coolness by the ears. Here a venerable Turk came up,
and beckoning us to follow him, led us up a flight of
steps to an airy gallery opening from this cool vault,
where was a divan with couches for our repose. Hence
we presently emerged, attired, like the Turks about, in
decorous togas and turbans, convertible into towels, and
with clogs on our feet, clattered awkwardly through the
spacious <i>Frigidarium</i>—how the whole brings to life the
luxurious days of ancient Rome!—and thence, after passing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
through an antichamber still cool, plunged into the
<i>Calidarium</i> with a vengeance. This was a domed chamber
of equal dimensions with the first, from which opened
several lesser rooms swelling into cupolas above. But
we were so suffocated with the hot steamy atmosphere,
that it was not till after we had been seated by our
attendant Turk on a daïs in one of these side-vaults, that
we recovered breath sufficient to take stock of anything.
Just behind us, from a leaden spout fixed in an
ogival niche in the wall, gushed forth a hot fountain into
a marble basin, out of which, after much patient endurance
of preliminary sudation, we were basted by our
minister. Then succeeded excoriation by a rough gauntlet
that served as strigil, then we were well lathered, and
so the process was repeated till a final douche of cold
water from a wooden bowl gave the signal for girding
ourselves once more and making our way through the
cool chamber—tenfold refreshing now!—to our couch.
Here, in the same turban and light attire as himself, we
accompanied a Turk in <i>dolce far niente</i> tempered with
fragrant mocha and cigarettes—though sherbet is equally
proper as a beverage, and a narghilé would perhaps have
been more decorous. The whole process, including the
time spent in recovering from our first succeeding lassitude,
lasted about an hour.</p>

<p>Thus re-invigorated, we renewed our exploration of
the streets of Serajevo—this time accompanied by a
gorgeous consular guard. Besides the baths there are
other fine stone buildings here, and the Bosniac countryman
gapes with as much wonderment at the domes of the
two chief mosques as an English rustic at first sight of
St. Paul’s. Of these two Dzàmias, or greater mosques,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
one, the Careva Dzàmia, is the work of Sultan Mohammed,
who conquered Bosnia; and the other, the Begova
Dzàmia, owes its foundation to Khosrev Beg, her first
Vizier. This latter is the largest, and externally, with
its central dome, subsidiary cupolas, and its portico in
front, preserves faithfully enough the characteristics of
its Christian Byzantine prototypes. Before it is a plot
planted with trees, and containing a stone font filled with
the purest water for the <i>ghusél</i> or religious lustrations.
In the porch are two monolithic columns of brown marble,
taken from an earlier Christian church: here, too, is a
shrine or chapel, in which is a gigantic sarcophagus,
containing the bones of the founder, and a smaller one
containing those of his wife—both, especially the former,
strewn with costly shawls by the hands of the pious. The
interior of the mosque is plain and whitewashed, except
for the texts of the Koràn upon the walls, and gay Persian
carpets strewn upon the pavement. There are two
pulpits, one for ordinary lessons and sermons; the other
a loftier perch used on Fridays for reading the prayer for
the Sultan; and in the wall may be seen a square stone,
the <i>Kiblà</i>, which marks the direction of Mecca. But we
ourselves were advised not to enter, owing to the dangerous
spirit of fanaticism abroad; so these details are
gathered second-hand.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p>Besides her mosques, Serajevo boasts two <i>Bezestans</i> or
‘cloth-halls,’ usually one of the chief public buildings of a
Turkish city. The larger of these includes a court, surrounded
by cloisters, and with a fountain in the middle;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
but from the outside you can see little of the building
except some stone cupolas, as the wooden shops of the
market are built against its walls. Inside we found ourselves
wandering along stone arcades vaulted above and
bayed at the side with semi-circular recesses, in which
the wares are displayed. They consist mostly of cloths;
and though light is deficient, the brilliance of the effect
is astonishing—the rich display of drapery might recall
a street of Ghent in the Middle Ages! Round the Bezestan
are crowded the narrow streets of the <i>Caršia</i> or
market—by exploring which you can arrive at a fairly
exhaustive knowledge of the industries of Serajevo. There
was not such a jumble of wares here as in the smaller
towns of Bosnia. Shops of a similar kind succeeded each
other in a row, or sometimes monopolised a whole street.
Here was the blacksmiths’ street, with a display of colossal
nails, and a large assortment of the elegant bosses of
Turkish door-handles with their knocker-like appendages.
Another street was sacred to harness-makers and sellers of
horse-trappings; in a third was a double arrangement—a
lower row of boot-shops conveniently level with the
ground, while, as a roof above the opanka-sellers’ heads,
ran the counters of crockery-merchants, with a charming
variety of <i>testjas</i> and other water jars—so that foot and
mouth could be suited at the same moment! Another
street resounded with the hammers of coppersmiths,
moulding their metal into coffee-pots or platters; here
were rows of salt-merchants, or we came upon a group
of armourers’ shops—to-day ominously thronged—bristling
with knives and swords of the famed Bosnian steel.
In the smaller Bezestan were many second-hand goods,
and amongst them magnificent flint-locks of antique form,
with stocks richly inlaid with mother-of-pearl and golden<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
arabesques—the masterpieces of the old workshops of
Prizren. Near these might be seen gun-flints such as
have been described already—the best quality of those
imported from Avlona.</p>

<p>But the part of the bazaar which interested us most
was the goldsmiths’ quarter. Here sate a whole street
full of cunning artificers, pinching and twisting the precious
metals—but chiefly silver—into brooches, beads,
rings, and ear-rings of filigree work—charming, both
from its intrinsic elegance and from its clearly marked
Byzantine parentage. The Serajevan work, pure and
simple, though not without merit, is somewhat coarse,
and we were pleased to find that the more graceful
flowers of silver-work had been engrafted on the rude
Bosnian stock by the taste of an English lady. Mrs.
Holmes, the wife of our hospitable Consul, brought over
some of the chefs-d’œuvre of Maltese filigree-work and
set these as models for the smiths of Serajevo, who have
so profited by the lesson that they are now almost able
to compete with the productions of the more refined
Italian artists. The Serajevan work has not, however,
degenerated into mere imitation: certain native characteristics
are still traceable in the new style.</p>

<p>Yet our Consul complained that, as regards skilful
workmanship, the incapacity of the Bosniacs was great
even compared with the Asiatic provinces of Turkey. In
Kurdistan, for example, he found no difficulty in obtaining
articles of furniture—sofas, and so forth—of European
elegance, by simply supplying patterns to the native
upholsterers; but here, when he tried to do the same,
people laughed at the very idea! The only carpenters
here are Austrians settled in Serajevo.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span></p>

<p>The motley groups of citizens of different denominations
which one comes upon in the streets of Serajevo
are at least as Oriental as the wares. Here is a kind of
happy family of Turks, Jews, Heretics, and Infidels. It
will be noticed that the Mahometan women of the capital
are not so rigorously veiled as those of the provincial
towns—Travnik, for example. Those of the better condition
here are infected with Stamboul fashions, and now
and then you will see a Mahometan lady pass in her
flowing peach-coloured silk, and a veil so transparent
that she might just as well have discarded it altogether.
As we descend in the social scale, modesty increases, and
I will not deny that many of the Serajevan women, with
their long white shrouds, bear a certain resemblance to
Lot’s wife after her metamorphosis; though with reluctance
it must be confessed that we sometimes saw a nose or
even an eye! It is amusing to watch the gradual transformations
of the little Mahometan girls here. How charming
was the little maiden opposite!—with her pale green
vest and flowing pink—can they be really pantaloons?—with
her childish beauty peeping forth from beneath a
scarlet fez—and so demure, too, for all her gorgeousness!
But by the time she is eleven the transitionary process
will begin; for a while she will content herself with
wrapping a cold white mantle round her head and her
pretty dress—for a while you may still catch a glimpse
of her face and the border of her fez—and then—the
cocoon!</p>

</figure>

<p>To the left of the group before us will be observed
two Jewesses belonging to the wealthiest part of the Serajevan
population. There are in this city about 2,000
Jews, descendants of those who, in the fifteenth and sixteenth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
centuries, took refuge from the persecutions of the
Catholic rulers of Spain within the dominions of the more
tolerant Grand Signior. But they still look back with a
certain regretful longing to the adopted land of their
forefathers. Although they can speak Bosniac to outsiders
without an accent, they still converse among themselves
in a language which was that of Spain in the days
of their expulsion; and the pure Castilian of the Knight
of La Mancha, antiquated in its mother-country, is still to
be heard in the streets of Serajevo!<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> They have a pride
in those old days, and like to keep fresh their remembrance.
Their Chacham-bashi, or head Rabbi, serves his
friends with confection made of white of eggs and sugar,
called ‘Spanish bread,’ as a kind of memorial feast. But
they cling with even warmer zeal to their old Hebrew
rites and customs, and are so intolerant of innovation
that, not long ago,<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> one of their leading merchants here
was excommunicated for letting his wife wear long hair
and dress herself in European fashion! She might well
have contented herself with the coiffure of her co-religionists;
for, if too wanton tresses are curtailed, <i>en
revanche</i> they wear a most gorgeous head-dress. We had
seen in the bazaar some tasteful discs of embroidered
work—flowered with a humming-bird brilliance of design—which
we took to be meant for small mats, till we found
that they were worn at the back of their heads by Jewish
women.</p>

<p>These Jews are the richest people in Serajevo, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
alas! this is not simply due to their commercial talents.
It is unfortunately too true that a few years ago these
astute Israelites made nearly 100,000<i>l.</i> out of Austrian
and German houses by a system of fraudulent bankruptcy.
They act as treasurers and interpreters to the Turkish
authorities in Bosnia, and use the power thus acquired to
amass further gains often not less ill-gotten. They are
also the chief bankers here, and the only usurers. They
are as dirty as their gains, and almost as degraded physically
as morally. That they are also undersized may
possibly be connected with the fact that they will only
marry within their community. On the other hand Miss
Irby<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> states that ‘their poor are exceedingly well cared
for, and a Jewish beggar is never seen. No Jew is ever
accused of murder, theft, or violence, or found in Turkish
prisons, except on account of debt.’</p>

<p>The other members of our happy family are the Bosniacs
of the Greek Church—the Serbs or Pravoslaves, as
they style themselves. Of these there are about 6,000 in
Serajevo, and they approach the Serbs of the Free Principality
in dress as well as in name. They show, as may
be seen, a great variety of head-dress—sometimes the
hair plaited round a central fez <i>à la Serbe</i>—sometimes
light white muslin drapery—sometimes a fez stuck
coquettishly on one side, from which descends what
looks like a cascade of black hair flecked with golden
spray, and of such a length as to fall about the hips.
It needs close inspection to detect that this is really black
silk interwoven with gold thread; so that the Serbian
maidens of Serajevo may be congratulated on adding
a cubit to their tresses! They further embellish their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
hair with flowery sprays, and, on high days, both fez
and bosom with a barbaric superfluity of jewellery—especially
coins. They carry their fortune about with
them, and a Bosniac girl is admired in proportion to
the number of coins that spangle her! Perhaps the
same may be seen elsewhere under a civilized disguise,
but here it is paraded with all the naïveté of the savage!
‘What a pretty girl!’ enthusiastically exclaimed a Bosniac,
in the Russian Hilferding’s hearing; and on his
asking with surprise what the Serajevan might find to
admire in a flat nose and a decided squint: ‘What?
Don’t you see? There are ducats there to last a lifetime!’
But there is one kind of beauty which even the
Bosniacs can admire, and that is—fatness! A fat<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> girl
is here synonymous with a beauty.</p>

<p>The character of the Christian merchants of Serajevo
is, perhaps, sufficiently indicated. They are, in
truth, a money-grubbing, unamiable lot, and, it need
hardly be added, set their faces against culture in every
form. Next to the Jews, they are the richest class in
Serajevo—richer than the Turks, for the Mahometan is
incapacitated by his fatalistic want of enterprize from
taking part in any but small retail trades. The Serbs,
on the contrary, hold in their hands most of the external
commerce of the country, for which Serajevo is
the natural staple, being the meeting-place of the main
roads leading to Austria, North of the Save, Dalmatia, and
Free Serbia, and being situate on the caravan route to
Stamboul. But they do not make use of the wealth thus
obtained either to elevate themselves or to aid their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
oppressed countrymen who lie outside the pale of consular
protection. On the contrary, they form themselves
into an exclusive caste, not only standing apart from the
miserable rayah, but even pooh-poohing his cry of agony
when it happens to stand a chance of being heard by
Foreign Consuls or the Turkish Governor. Is it likely,
indeed, that they should do otherwise, with such a
spiritual guide as the Fanar Metropolitan?</p>

<p>Just as characteristic of a narrow-minded bourgeoisie
is the way in which they set their faces against any
attempts to better their education. A few years ago a
Serb of Serajevo, who had amassed what for a Bosniac
was a fortune, as a merchant at Trieste, left a
considerable sum of money to be applied in erecting a
good school for the Pravoslave community here, on condition
of a certain additional sum being subscribed by
the Serajevan merchants. The Pravoslave community at
large seem to have received the tidings of this generous
bequest with sublime contempt; but one or two individuals,
who hoped to profit by it as teachers, took the matter up
and sent a circular to the European Consuls in the name
of the whole Serb community, stating that that body
‘feeling the want of a good education for their sons, and
wishing to carry out the design of their benefactor,
solicited the aid and patronage of the representatives of
enlightened Christendom.’ This sounded very fine. The
Consuls took the matter up. Mr. Holmes represented
it to the English Government, and though nothing
could be given officially, Lord Clarendon very kindly
forwarded 30<i>l.</i> on his own behalf. Then the bubble
burst. The Pravoslave community held an indignation
meeting, in which they disavowed the circular of these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
interested enthusiasts for education: protesting that their
children were well enough taught at home, and that a
new school they did not want, and a new school they
would not have!</p>

<p>Two other most prominent classes of Serajevan society
call for mention. One is the Board of Health, whose
business it is to keep the streets comparatively clean.
The members of this sanitary staff exercise their unclean
office at night, when they patrol the streets in troops—and
the offal which they then pick up is their only food! At
this season these scavengers, who are perpetually falling
out among themselves, raise such a terrible hubbub as
murders sleep to those unused to their rowdiness. Moreover,
it is hardly safe to walk across the street after dark,
for these gentry will patch up their own quarrels and unite
to assault the unwary foot-passenger; and, though they
have no other weapons than those wherewith nature has
endowed them, such is the ferocity of their onset that I
have myself seen a Turkish soldier forced to keep these
guardians of the public health at bay with his sword.
They do not wear either fez or turban (so far as we were
able to observe), and in this they differ from the generality
of Turkish officials; but they are uniformed in a coarse
hide of a muddy buff-colour, disfigured with mangy
patches, usually out at elbows, and tattered by reason of
their nocturnal brawls, in which they show themselves so
transported with passion as to tear off each other’s ears.
By day they are very <i>lazzaroni</i>, and are to be seen in the
streets (their only home), lying across the path or roadway
on their stomachs—truly a disgusting spectacle.
It is a custom not to be transgressed, that both the
passers-by, and even waggons, should move out of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>
way while my lords are taking their repose; and it goes
ill with him who should kick, or even, without hostile intent,
stumble upon the prostrate sanitary officer, since he
and his fellows—a score of whom (you may be sure) are
ready at hand—are quick in taking the law into their own
hands. Nor can their insulter expect either aid or pity
from the bystanders; for the citizens, rightly considering
their profession as necessary to the public health, invest
their person with a certain sanctity; and, doubtless, were
these brutish scavengers expelled by one gate, pestilence
would stalk in by the other.</p>

<p>Then there is another class of functionaries with
whom the streets of Serajevo, and one in particular, are
literally swarming, and who are even more brutal than
this precious Sanitary Board. These are the Zaptiehs—call
them, if you please, gendarmes, police, enlisting
sergeants, soldiers, tax-collectors, executioners—for they
are Jacks-of-all-trades. They are the factotums of the
Mahometan government—a terrible engine in the hands
of tyranny—ready to execute its worst behests. We
have seen them as the instruments of the tax-farmer or
the bishop, wringing the little hoards of penury from the
miserable rayah—or playing the part of apparitors in
those Inquisition scenes of torture. These are the hired
bravoes who live at free-quarters in the Christian villages;
rob, violate—and in many cases murder—whom they
will. There are of course exceptions; and their worst
offences are nothing to the infamy of the Government
which lets loose ignorant fanatics among a population
whom their creed teaches them to count as dogs, and
which leaves them, without pay sufficient for their bare
subsistence, to plunder those whom they nominally protect.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
When in the presence of Europeans they usually possess
tact sufficient to keep on their good behaviour; but from
the atrocious scenes of which I myself was a witness at
the Christian pilgrimage, their conduct, when freed from
any restraint of foreign surveillance, may be faintly
imagined. Those who have had most acquaintance with
the country described them to us as ‘covering the land
like a blight.’ Though there are enough of them in
Serajevo in all conscience, we were assured that the
number at present here is smaller than usual, since many
have been sent out to collect the Redìf or reserve, and
many have been hastily draughted into the soldiery.
To-day a gang of these commissioned bandits has been
scouring the country with orders to seize thirty horses,
but they have only been able to lay hands on a couple.
The Government exercises the right of seizing horses at
need. Nominally it is only a loan, but the peasants rarely
see their beasts back, and dare not hope for recompense
of any kind; besides which the owner is often impressed
himself as kiradjì or driver, without receiving a penny for
this <i>corvée</i>. This forced labour and seizure of horses was
one of the most crying wrongs of the Bosnian and Herzegovinian
rayahs, and one of the many causes of the
revolt. How inveterate must be that misgovernment
which continues to sow the wind at the very moment that
it is reaping the whirlwind!</p>

<p>Here, at least, affairs are becoming hourly more
ominous. We hear tidings of a Christian victory near
Novipazar, which means that the single road connecting
Bosnia with the rest of Turkey is seriously threatened.
Isolated tales of bloodshed and massacre form the common
topic of conversation. A Serb cuts the throat of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
Turkish Mollah near Mostar; the Christian is hanged; his
friends surprise a party of Mahometans in an inn, and
massacre them to a man; the cry for vengeance is now
caught up by the Turks, and so the tragedy developes.
Such details are revolting, but they give a true picture of
the reign of terror which is setting in. To-day a large
number of Austrian women, the wives of artizans beyond
the Save, are leaving the town.</p>

<p>This evening, our last in this city, a strange atmospheric
phenomenon seemed to shadow forth the uncertainty
of all around. In the afternoon it began to pour,
and at first the clouds, as they shifted hither and thither,
threw the mountains, that frown around the city on every
side, into strange and novel reliefs. Then they sank
lower, till they hung like a pall above mosque and
minaret, and shrouded even the ‘nodding hills’ around in
impenetrable gloom—half cloud, half mountain. The
city alone stood out with clear and well defined outlines
in the livid half-light, but the mist literally lapped its
outer walls, and so thickly, that a foe might have approached
to the very entrance of the town without possibility
of detection. It was, indeed, portentous of the
present state of Serajevo; nothing but the present certain;
her nearest future overclouded; forebodings of internecine
struggles within; the sulphurous vapours of
civil and religious war rising around her—doubly awful
in the uncertain light of rumour. ‘It is the beginning of
the end,’ said a foreign representative to us; ‘do not be
surprised if you are surveying the last days of Ottoman
rule in the Serai.’</p>

<p><i>Aug. 24th.</i>—This being our last morning in Serajevo,
we thought it prudent, taking into account the troublousness
of the times and the perils that might beset our
further pilgrimage, to have recourse to those magic arts, in
which the Moslems of this city show themselves so proficient.
To this end we have devoted the forenoon to ransacking
the shops of the silversmiths, who chiefly traffic
in such wares, for amulets, and stones of divers virtues;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
and, assuredly, if there be aught in ‘mystic cabala and
spells,’ we may consider ourselves secure from evil.</p>

<p>When the Turks knew for what we were looking,
they brought out strange caskets, and opened many a
hidden drawer, that they might set before us gems and
talismans of antique form. And many of these turbaned
sages who had not such wares to impart for filthy lucre,
yet, that they might hold before us, as it were, a beacon
wherewith to guide our footsteps in the path of true
philosophy, would display to us the rings and periapts
that they wore on their person, or would take out
potent stones from their wallets for our perusal. By this
means we obtained much instruction in the cabalistic
science of these true believers. Much virtue lies, it would
appear, in the character of the stone itself, and a red carnelian
carried about the person, or set in a signet ring, is
held as potent an amulet as any. ’Twas a stone like this
that the Princess Badoura wore in a purse attached to her
girdle. When the curiosity of the luckless Camaralzaman
prompted him to open this, he found therein ‘a red carnelian,
engraven with unknown figures and characters.
“This carnelian,” says the prince to himself, “must have
something extraordinary in it, or my princess would not
be at the trouble to carry it with her.” And indeed it
was Badoura’s talisman or a scheme of her nativity
drawn from the constellations of heaven, which the Queen
of China had given her daughter as a charm that would
keep her from any harm as long as she had it about her.’</p>

<p>Many of the stones were simply signets for rings, and
derived their virtue merely from their material—red carnelian
or blood-stone. These signets, however, not unfrequently
were engraved with stars or a branch of mystic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
import, besides the Arabic name of the bearer. The talismans,
pure and simple, are generally to be distinguished
from simple seals by the writing not being reversed. To
obtain such stones was naturally difficult, but I secured
one, a red carnelian, engraved with the cabalistic words
‘<i>Excellence belongs to God</i>,’ and another mysterious
charm—a blood-stone with monogrammatic spells which
no Arabian scholar has yet been able to decipher for me—arranged
in a Solomon’s seal. Ami Boué, who was
struck with the number of charms used by the Mahometans
of these parts, notices among the inscriptions on
them, ‘<i>the servant of God</i>,’ ‘<i>I trust in God</i>.’ Many curious
parallels might be cited among the posies of old English
rings.</p>

<p>It is interesting to notice the repute in which the
blood-stone is held here for these sigils and talismans.
Those who are familiar with Gnostic gems will remember
how often this stone, as well as the carnelian, appears
engraved with the names of Iao, or Abrasax, or others of
that mysterious race of genii. I have myself seen several
Gnostic gems of this character from the Roman sites of
the Illyrian coast land, and indeed cannot refrain from
hinting a suspicion that there may be something more
than a chance connection between the abundance of such
charms in ancient and in modern Illyria.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> Those who
recognize how much the Mahometan Sclaves of Bosnia
have preserved of their earlier Christian superstitions will
hardly think it improbable that part at least of their wide-spread
belief in the potency of such charms may be an
inheritance from Præ-Turkish times.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span></p>

<p>To answer such questions with confidence more evidence
is needed. This, however, is certain, that the
present abundance of such charms in Bosnia is partly due
to geological causes, being favoured by the presence of
stones adapted for the manufacture, in some of the Illyrian
valleys. We saw many such stones vended on
the bridges of Serajevo by itinerant pedlars—an abundance
of rudely cut carnelians, blood-stones, amethysts,
agates, and rock crystals—intended not only for sigils
and amulets, but also for purposes purely ornamental.
It was the abundance of such stones that made Illyria—as
I hope to point out later on—the seat of a regular
manufacture of Roman gems. These seem to be found
in considerable abundance on all Roman sites in Illyria;
and even in Serajevo, where there are no remains of
Roman habitation beyond a solitary votive inscription to
the Thunderer,<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> we noticed several classic gems scattered
among more modern talismans and signets. One which
I succeeded in purchasing is a masterpiece of ancient art.
The stone is a sard of a deep red colour, on which is engraved
a faun holding an amphora on his shoulder; the
proportions are perfect, and the whole so exquisitely engraved,
that not a flaw in the execution can be detected
even with the aid of a strong magnifying-glass.</p>

<p>The Prince of the Isles of the children of Khaledan
was not more troubled when the bird of ill-omen snatched<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
the blood-red carnelian of Badoura from his grasp, than
is a Bosniac who has lost or broken his talisman. At
Jablanica, in the valley of the Narenta, we heard of a
Turk who a few days before had broken his amulet-ring.
The poor man’s terror was piteous to see, and fearing that
the injury to his charm portended that some terrible misfortune
would overtake him, or that at least his hours were
numbered, he immediately set out on a ten hours’ journey
to Mostar, that the injury might be repaired by cunning
artificers.</p>

<p>Not that this belief in charms is by any means confined
to the Moslems of Bosnia. The Christians are
equally given to it, and I saw some cabalistic gems with
crosses and inscriptions in Cyrillian characters. The sale
of amulets and charms, written on small slips of paper, is
in fact a regular source of income to the Franciscan monks
of this country, so much so that they no longer take the
trouble to write their spells, but have called in the invention
of printing to aid the Black Art! ‘At the present
day,’ writes M. Yriarte, ‘it is no secret that the printing
of these little cards is a recognised branch of industry
with certain typographic establishments at Agram and
Zara.’<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> The spells consist of verses of Scripture disposed
in the same cabalistic fashion as verses of the Koràn
among the native Mahometans; they are folded in the
shape of a hat and suspended in a small wallet round
the neck of the rayah, who looks to his purchase for
protection against the Evil Eye and infernal spirits! If
the Franciscan monks take a leaf from the Koràn,
the Moslems on their part return the compliment; and
it is not the least curious trace of the lurking <i>penchant</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
for the faith of their fathers betrayed by some of the
descendants of the Bosnian renegades, that at times
Mahometans have been known to send their amulets to
the Franciscan monks that their blessing might lend an
additional potency to the charm.</p>

<p>Among the Mahometans here scrolls containing verses
from the Koràn are a very favourite amulet, and the modern
Bosniacs show themselves as prone as the Pharisees of old
‘to enlarge their phylacteries.’ Sometimes these sacred excerpts
are sewn into the dress, sometimes hung round the
neck, or attached to the arm. One of our Zaptiehs showed
us his, enclosed in a leathern case, in much the same
manner as in a specimen which I have seen from Egypt.
This was fastened round the upper part of his arm—a
thoroughly Eastern mode of wearing amulets—if I may
be allowed once more to call in evidence Prince Camaralzaman,
who, on recovering dear Badoura’s carnelian,
‘having first kissed the talisman, wrapped it up in a
ribbon, and tied it carefully about his arm.’</p>

<p>But of periapts those that took our fancy most, and of
which we took care to lay in a goodly store for our own
use, were certain necklaces or amulets from which were
suspended carnelian arrowheads. Of these there was a
regular traffic, and we saw large bunches of them hung
up for sale in the larger bezestan; on enquiring their use,
the merchant who sold them informed me that they were
a most valuable and potent charm against skin diseases—in
an Oriental city not an unimportant consideration—and
insinuated, as a minor attraction, that if I wore them
I need never be afraid of warts. I have seen exactly
similar charms in Bulgaria, and others from Arabia, which
are worn by the Arabs ‘as good for the blood’—so that
their cutaneous virtues are widely appreciated. The Serajevan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
merchant said that they were imported from India—and,
indeed, the Ganges may almost be said to have
flowed into the Save! But the miniature arrowheads of
these amulets command as high an interest from their
form as from their Indian origin; and the sanctity with
which superstition has invested what was once the everyday
weapon of mankind, is one of the many proofs of
the antiquity of that Stone Age which preceded the
period when Bronze was the only metal known to mankind,
and, at a remoter distance, this blessed Age of Iron.</p>

<p>We heard of other charms suspended round horses’
necks, though I am not in a position to describe any of
these. But perhaps the most curious amulets were those
worn by children against the Evil Eye. Here are some
that we succeeded in carrying off. Figures 1, 2, 3, 4, are of
lead, severally representing a hare, a fish, a crested serpent,
a tortoise. No. 5 is the claw of an eagle or some
kind of bird, and No. 7 the horns of a stag beetle; both
of these are mounted in tin sockets. No. 6 is a rude face
carved in jet. These are fixed on the child’s fez, or elsewhere
about the person, and the object served is to avert
the first stroke, or as the Italians say the <i>Gettatura</i> of the
Cattiv’ Occhio; this first stroke being alone considered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
fatal. It is for this reason that the amulets against its
malign influence are usually of bizarre forms, in order to
attract the <i>Gettatura</i> to themselves. But the natural objects—notably
the animals, representations of which are
used for this purpose here—are extremely interesting, inasmuch
as they very strongly suggest a continuity with
the amulets against the Evil Eye in use in classic times.
Thus, on ancient gems the eye is seen surrounded by a
lion, a hare, a dog, a scorpion, a stag and a serpent.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>
There is, besides, a well-known class of Roman brooches
in the form of fishes, the animals mentioned above, and
others, which may, one would think, with great propriety
be looked on as nothing but amulets of the same kind,
and many of which bear a striking resemblance to these
Bosnian charms. Nor is this superstition, any more than
the others, at all confined to the Mahometans of Bosnia;
it is universal among the Serbs, who, it is said,<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> find great
deliverance from the evil effects of the Cattiv’ Occhio by
touching iron or looking at blue objects, and the Franciscan
spells already described are chiefly directed against
this same malign influence.</p>

<p>Having now fortified ourselves to our satisfaction with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
these and many talismans of virtue, and being supplied by
our kind hosts at the Consulate with a store of wheaten
bread, Bologna sausages, and eke Sicilian wine, we bade
farewell to our friends at Serajevo, and set forth on foot
once more. It was our intention to make our way as
best we could to the Herzegovina over the wild ranges
to the West, and, as the best line of attack on our mountain
citadels, made for the gorge of the Želesnica over the
foot of lower hills. About an hour from Serajevo we
passed the last trace of comparative civilization. This
was a brewery recently established by two Austrian
settlers, with one of whom we conversed whilst discussing
a glass of very fair German beer. The poor man
was in a great state of trepidation. Only the day before
his brother brewer had made off for the Austrian frontier,
taking with him his family, and our host himself was
preparing to follow his partner’s example as soon as he
could get his effects together. ‘It’s not the Insurgents,’
he said, ‘that I’m afraid of—it’s only the Turks. You
can’t believe what cut-throats those Bashi-Bazouks are!’</p>

<p>This was hardly inspiriting for ourselves, nor did our
prospects seem more brilliant when, an hour or so afterwards,
in a lonely part of the Želesnica valley, to which
we had now descended, we heard a hue and cry behind
us, and turning round saw a ferocious horseman armed
to the teeth, clattering after us on a gorgeously caparisoned
steed. Our infantry thereupon formed, and the
cavalry halted a few paces off. Whereupon our dragoon,
who, from the sumptuousness of his arms, must have been
a Beg at least, roared out to us some commands, in which
the insolence alone was intelligible. Thereupon we continued
our march, resolved to pay no attention to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
insults of the foe; but seeing that he hung about our
flanks, and that his general demeanour was becoming
momentarily more hostile, we made such an unmistakable
sign that we had been sufficiently honoured by his
company that he thought better of the matter and beat
a retreat. There is one weapon which in Bosnia serves
as efficiently for a passport as the Bujuruldu of the
Governor-General!</p>

<p>We were in a certain amount of anxiety lest the
enemy should renew his attack with reinforcements, but
the valley grew wilder and the darkness was rapidly
closing in to hide our position. Further up the stream
we passed those two monuments, one with a crescent
moon engraved upon it, which have been already described—and
the position was one which the persecuted
Bogomiles might well have chosen. Towards dusk the valley
widened out a bit, and we perceived a village a little
higher up; but not wishing to run the risk of letting our
whereabouts be known, and infinitely preferring the open
canopy of heaven to the vermin-ridden shelter of a Bosnian
cabin, we sought out some other resting-place for
the night, and soon discovered eligible quarters among
some haystacks in a meadow by the side of the stream.
These haystacks were of a peculiar form, being composed
of small sheaves of hay skewered on an upright pole, but
they afforded very welcome shelter from the night breeze;
so that after taking our tea and an evening meal of simple
contrivance, we lay down and slept sound enough till
dawn.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 25th.</i>—We had breakfasted and were on our
way again by half-past four next morning, and the
light of the rising sun revealed to us a most beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
cliff of rock, as it were of ivory veined with gold, rising
above our encampment. After passing the straggling
village of Jablanica, which we had seen the night before,
the valley contracted, and we were forced to climb along
a rocky steep overlooking the torrent on the left. The
mountains on each side grew higher, wooded with small
oaks, thorns, and beeches, with here and there a brilliant
Colossus of rock in the same chryselephantine style; while
the stream below, pent up in so precipitous a gorge,
naturally waxed more boisterous, and dashed from one
emerald pool to another, flaked with snow-white foam. But
our steep quickly became so impassable by reason of rocky
bastions, that we were forced to relinquish our design of
following the water-course, and in preference ascended
the mountain whose flank we had been hitherto hugging.
We made our way upwards with difficulty through the
tangled brushwood, and from this summit descended
once more through the stunted oaks, intending to steer
for a hilly ridge running south-west towards Mt. Bielastica.
Chancing, however, to hit on a path more or less in our
direction, we followed it, and found ourselves before long
at a small Christian hamlet consisting of two or three
huts, each, as usual, in its paled enclosure. Here we found
some peasants—men in long white tunics, women with
dress and coiffure of Serbian fashion—all of whom were
very friendly, and hastened to satisfy our thirst with sour
milk. One of the girls, in the bloom of her age,
was really beautiful. Both her hair and eyes, shaded
with eyebrows low and broad, were dark, and, in the
refinement of her features, the pale olive of her complexion,
softly contrasting with her raven tresses and
sparkling sombreness of eye, there was a charm almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
Italian—had it not yet been eminently South-Sclavonic.
She seemed as amiable as she was lovely, and was
evidently recognised as a belle even in her small circle;
for she alone, we noticed, was possessed of ear-rings.
Her comeliness was indeed the <i>beau idéal</i> of Serbian
fancy; but I should hardly have drawn attention to it
here, were not really transcendent beauty so rarely seen
among these uncultured South-Sclavonic peoples, perhaps
one might say, among the barbarous members of our
Aryan family generally. In a highly civilized society
like our own, the proportion of Peris—if I dare generalize—is
greater; but, on the other hand, if anyone wishes to
find examples of the deepest human degradation, he must
search, not among the mountain homes of the oppressed
rayahs of Bosnia, but rather in the alleys of one of our
great cities. With us the gamut of beauty is greater.</p>

<p>But it is high time to take a fond farewell! so,
leaving this flower of the Bosnian highlands ‘to blush
unseen, and waste its sweetness on the desert air,’ we
began ascending our ridge, and finding another path,
came, an hour or so further on, to a leafy canopy supported
by four poles, beneath which squatted two venerable
Mahometans with sage and hoary beards. We
recognised the signs of a rustic <i>café</i>, and taking our seats
on a convenient grassy bank, refreshed ourselves with
sundry fragrant cupfuls, the while much delighting our
ancient coffee-maker and his fellow with an exhibition of
English hunting-knives. We soon after reached the summit
of the ridge, and following it along a succession of
down-like lawns, gained, from its southern-most bluff
just above the Priesnica torrent, a fine mountain panorama,
and in especial a good view of the limestone precipices<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
of Mt. Trescovica (which here forms the boundary
between Bosnia and Herzegovina), frowning over lower
forest-covered heights. So sharp was the contrast between
the bold curves and contortions of the light limestone rock
and the softer contours and verdant shades beneath, that
one could fancy that the green undulations of the Planinas
round had at one point burst into foaming billows; and,
indeed, the mountain crest seemed to curl over as to
imitate a breaking wave,—but alas! how flat is the poetry
of nature when reduced to black and white by a prosaic
pencil!</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus41" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus41.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Mount Trescovica, from South-Eastern Spur of Mount Igman.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We now wanted to make our way into the Narenta
valley over the north-west shoulder of Mt. Bielastica, but
were turned out of our course by the deep gorge of the
Priesnica, and thought it best to ascend the south-eastern
promontory of a largish range known by the name of Mt.
Igman—though the title covers a multitude of peaks.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
The scenery now became more beautiful than ever,
though profoundly lonely, save here and there for a beautiful
black squirrel leaping from branch to branch, or a
huge brown vulture floating through the azure overhead.
The steeps up which we now made our way were covered
with forest more varied in its composition than those of
Troghìr and Vučia. Beech, as there, was the predominant
tree; but oaks and thorns, dark firs and pines, glaucous
ashes and fountainous birches—often so happily blended
and grouped as to transcend the planter’s art—disputed
the sole dominion of the queen of the forest. The trees
were perhaps hardly so large, as a rule, as those we had
seen in the mountains of more northern Bosnia, but we
noticed one pine no less than eighteen feet in circumference
at a yard from the ground. Another speciality of
this forest-mountain was that the trees were not so thickly
crowded, and grew more freely. The sovereign beech has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
no need to gird herself so closely, but can stretch out her
queenly arms, and spread far and wide her leafy flounces
without fear of her robes being pressed and crumpled by
the crowd. Glades are here more frequent, and ever and
anon a charming lawny break would open a vista through
the trees, and we caught a glimpse of the distant ridge of
Bielastica.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus42" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus42.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Mount Bielastica from slopes of Mt. Igman.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We reached two summits of the mountain we were
on, the first by our aneroid 4,350 feet above sea-level,
the second 4,560. About these summits, which were less
wooded than the lower regions, we found a variety of
flowers, recalling the flora of our chalk downs—the
yellow snapdragon, the scabious, white as well as mauve,
and the heartsease, though larger and of a richer purple,
much as we remembered them on our own Chilterns; and
here, as there, the chalk-hill blue seemed the commonest
butterfly. But besides these we noticed rosy sweet-williams
and autumn crocus, with its double trinity of lilac
petals—iris-like—a design for a gothic window. On one
summit, gained earlier in the day, we found a curious
bulbous plant with a tall stalk and drooping purple bells,
each curving down on a separate stem like a pigmy
snake’s head;<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> and some mountain lawns shone blue as
the sky above, with a wondrous thistle whose leaves as
well as flowers were tinged on their upper surface with a
bright azure.</p>

<p>But what surprised me most, was to see the Solomon’s
seal-like flower, which we had noticed in all the Bosnian
forests, bristle up erect and stiff on the breezy mountain
summit, after undergoing such a transformation that I
should not have known it for the same plant had not I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
marked the gradual transition. It was now for the first
time that I identified the mysterious floral weeping-willow,
which had delighted us so often, with an old
friend—the autumn gentian. As we descended the mountain
we watched the transition with astonishment. The
flowers, instead of circling the upright stem in a perfect
coronal, crept to the upper side of it as it gradually declined.
The leaves and bells grew larger—the stem as
much as two feet long—till in the damper parts of the
forest the whole was once more transformed into what
looked like Solomon’s seal with tall azure cups stretching
upwards from the back of its drooping stem—a perfect
emblem of hope in sorrow.</p>

<p>But a curious feature in the mountain formation began
to make itself painfully felt. There was no water. All
the streams ran below ground. Vale and mountain were
alike pitted with those inverted-conical hollows—the
<i>Dolinas</i>, which we remembered in the limestone wilderness
of Carniola—that terrible Karst. These circular
hollows are nothing but swallow-holes, formed by the
water in its passage to the caverns of its underground
course. And so it happened that we were forced to
climb on, hour after hour, through the mid-day heat of
a Southern sun, without discovering a drop to drink. Our
intense thirst rendered us so desperate that we willingly
forsook our proper course to plunge into deep gorges in
the forlorn hope of finding water. But it was invariably
to find that all our labour had been wasted, and that
we must climb upwards once more and seek elsewhere.
Three times we thought that we had succeeded, and
as many times we were disappointed; twice what we
hoped to be drinkable turned out to be a filthy pool,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
almost too bad for cattle; once, however, we thought to
have procured some from a shepherd whose temporary
hut had attracted our attention from a height above. The
poor man went and fetched us a bucket of liquid, but it
was green slime! At last, about four in the afternoon—after
eight hours of hard struggle since the coffee which we
had quaffed at the roadside shed—almost fainting with
drought we found, in a moist part of a track that we had
hit on, some mules’ footprints, in which some of the rainwater
from the storm of the previous day was still standing.
This we eagerly sucked up through a hollow hemlock
stem; and, though the beaker was novel, were much
refreshed.</p>

<p>But what with our frantic searches after water and
vain attempts to find a pass which exists nowhere but on
the Major’s map, we had diverged very seriously from
our right direction; and, on reaching a mountain edge,
we discerned ourselves far out in our bearings, and far
too much to the north-east. Two thousand feet below
us we descried an inhabited country, and, delicious
sight! a stream; and though night was closing in, and
both my brother and myself are subject to the inconvenience
of being night-blind, we resolved, if possible, to
descend to this friendly valley before darkness set in. It
was a race against night; but we literally bounded down,
and striking on a shepherd’s path, were able to run the
rest of the way, and descended two thousand feet and
were quenching all the thirst of the day in the crystal
stream, within half an hour from the time when we
reached the mountain edge. A peasant whom we here
met conducted us to a Han on the high road a little way
off, and we found ourselves under shelter exactly sixteen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
hours after our start in the morning, during which time
we had given ourselves hardly any rest.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus43" style="max-width: 43.75em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus43.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Plan of Bosnian Han.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><i>Aug. 26th.</i>—Our Han was a miserable little hovel,
consisting chiefly of one room, which served at once for
kitchen, squatting-room, and bedchamber, in which we
slept on a wooden daïs amongst a lot of ragged Turks;
but travellers must expect strange bed-fellows—and after
all, our chamber was comparatively flealess. We found
that we were on the high road which connects Sarajevo,
with Mostar, the capital of the Herzegovina, but on the
wrong side of the pass, and about seven hours’ walk from
Coinica, the first town in the duchy of St. Sava, and our
this day’s destination. We stopped on our way to refresh
ourselves at a Han, of which I give a plan and elevation,
in order to convey an idea of the ordinary cottage in this
part of Bosnia: for the dwelling-houses are like the inns,
except that their entrance arch opens on to the yard and
not on to the road. The lower part is, as usual, reserved
for horses and cattle. Making your way through these
stables you ascend a ladder in the middle and emerge
above on a central hall, at once guest-room and kitchen,
with a divan at one end round a bay window open to the
air, and the rafters above literally tarred by the smoke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
which rises from a chimneyless hearth of flat stones. The
external walls here are of stone—a Herzegovinian characteristic.</p>

<p>We now ascended the pass which here forms the
watershed between the Black Sea and the Adriatic, and on
our way met a party of Bashi-Bazouks,—according to
all accounts the most serious danger that we were liable
to meet with. They stopped us; but by great good fortune
there happened to be a regular officer with them
who understood our pass, and explaining its purport to
the others, suffered us to pass on amidst commendatory
ejaculations of ‘<i>Dobro! dobro!</i>’—‘Good! good!’ This
piece of luck we attributed not only to the amulets on our
person, but to the herb <i>amulet</i>, or cyclamen, which bloomed
in the crevices of the cliffs, and a few of whose delicious
flowers we had plucked, and with great forethought carried
with us. The summit of the pass was, according to our
observations, 3,080 feet above sea-level. Just here we
had another slight adventure, for entering what we took to
be a new Han, we discovered on reaching the upper storey
that it was a Turkish watch-tower—one of the block-houses
hastily run up on the outbreak of the insurrection.
The soldiers, however, justly concluding that none but
friends would plunge thus boldly into their midst, showed
themselves very friendly, and gave us water, which we
asked for, to drink. We met some other parties of
volunteers, but were not molested.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus44.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>First Glimpse of the Herzegovina.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>As we descended the pass towards the valley of the
Narenta, the scenery became grand and beautiful. To
the left rose the grey limestone precipices of Bielastica,
above the nearer forest-covered heights. The base of
the mountain forms a wooded slope; above this succeeds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
a barren glacis of talus, and above this again tower
the perpendicular walls of the mountain-citadel itself
(for it looks uncommonly like an ancient fortress), with
here and there magnificent bastions and even round-towers
of rock, relieving the rugged-level line of the
citadel walls. To the right of us rose another nearer
wall of rock, along whose surface our roadway had been
hewn out, in places not without engineering skill. This
cliff was of a schistose formation, stained of the most
brilliant varieties of hue—rich browns of every shade, a
golden orange and a rose so deep and decided that we
invoked the neighbouring cinnabar mines of Creševo in
order to account for it. In places, again, the rocky wall
was formed of sombre slate, but it too could take exquisite
hues of lilac in a favourable light, and as we descended
lower into the valley the rocks grew white as
chalk. Below us was the deep gorge of a torrent, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
on its further side the strata were in places knotted
and grained and gnarled, like the roots of an old oak-tree.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus45" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus45.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>View of Coinica.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now, at a turn of the road, opens our first glimpse of
the ancient duchy of St. Sava—or, as it is now more generally
known, the Herzegovina—a magnificent vista of
rocky mountains rising beyond the yet unseen valley of
the Narenta, their dark blue shadows golden-fringed by
the setting sun. The trees become more southern in
their character; here and there are fine Spanish chestnuts;
on a height to the right are the pines of an Italian
landscape; wild vine becomes plentiful once more; we
pass a Herzegovinian peasant in a peaked cap of Dalmatian
character; and finally come in sight of Coinica, the first
Herzegovinian town, with mosque and minaret reflected
on the silvery waters of the Narenta; and behind, in a
glorious amphitheatre, those barren limestone peaks,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
which, stretching away in unbroken chains to the Black
Mountain on the south-east, form the Switzerland of
Turkey, and are ringing even now with the battle-cry of
freedom.</p>

<p>Across the river, and connecting the few houses on
the Bosnian shore, known as Neretva, with Coinica on
the other, is stretched a fine stone bridge, the finest we
had seen in Bosnia, and indeed the only one that we had
seen outside the walls of the capital. This is one of
the oldest historic monuments in the country, and is said
to have been the work of Hralimir,<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> King of the Serbs,
though it has doubtless been restored by the Turks.
Thus it is a living witness of the ancient connection between
Bosnia and Serbia, in its wider sense, with which the
history of Herzegovina, originally under Serbian princes,
begins; and it forms a fitting avenue of approach to
Coinica itself, which is celebrated in the history of the
Bosnian kingdom as the scene of one of the few peaceful
events in that unhappy national story that have become
memorable. Coinica was in a certain sense the Runnymede
of Bosnia. At the ‘Conventus’ or diet of Coinica
in 1446, Thomas, last lawful king of this country, set his
seal to a charter, which, though rather framed to protect
royalty and the feudal <i>régime</i>, was in this sense a
popular measure, that it was designed to check violence
and abuses in days of anarchy, and that it was presented
to the king for signature by an assembly of prelates and
barons, who in a certain sense were representative. Its
preservation is due to monks of the order of St. Francis,
one of whom supplied a Latin copy of it to Farlato,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
who was thus able to insert it in his ‘Illyricum Sacrum.’<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a>
As we are on the spot, and as this is an unique constitutional
memorial of the old Bosnian kingdom, and
illustrates amongst other things the relation in which the
two countries on whose borders we now are stood to
one another in the days of Christian government, I have
ventured to subjoin a translation:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>We, Stephen Thomas, by the grace of God, King of Rascia, Servia,
of the Bosnians or Illyrians, of the parts of Primorie of Dalmatia and
of Croatia, commit to memory, by the authority of these present, to all
whom it may concern as hereinafter ordained.</p>

<p>In an Assembly, holden by us in our land of Coinica,<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> and in our
Congregation General,<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> all our faithful vassals, prelates, barons, Voivodes,
and elders,<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> and all elected nobles of all the counties of our realm
treating of those things which pertain to the peace and well-being of
our realm: these foresaid elders, amongst other praiseworthy ordinances,
set before us and presented certain articles hereinafter set forth,
humbly praying that we would think well to confirm the articles aforesaid:—</p>

<p><i>Firstly</i>—That the Manichæans<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> build no new church, nor restore
the old.</p>

<p><i>Secondly</i>—That goods given to the Church be not taken away.</p>

<p><i>Thirdly</i>—That if any one slay a man, let him by royal judgment be
cast into prison, and let his goods be divided into two parts, one part
to be forfeited to the king and one part to the kinsmen of him slain.</p>

<p><i>Fourthly</i>—That when the councillors, secretaries, Voivodes, and
counts of the royal court,<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> are chosen, they must solemnly swear oath
to the king.</p>

<p><i>Fifthly</i>—That the Duke<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> of St. Sava be not lawful duke unless he
be chosen by the king of Rascia, Serbia, and Illyricum. After election
let him swear oath to the king’s majesty. But if he presume to
exercise office without taking the oath, the king’s majesty shall punish
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span></p>

<p><i>Sixthly</i>—That incestuous and the corrupters of kinspeople be
punished.</p>

<p><i>Seventhly</i>—That the betrayers of fenced cities<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> and of their lords pay
the penalties of their treason; and also the utterers of false money.</p>

<p>To the perpetual memory and confirmation of which things we
have sanctioned the constitutions written in this Charta by the setting
on of our great seal: by the will and counsel of the lords, prelates,
Voivodes, and elders of the whole kingdom. Given at Coinica, and
written by the most reverend father in Christ, lord Vladimir Vladmirović,
bishop of Creševo and of the Narentines, of the Greek rite, secretary
of our court,<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> and doctor of Greek letters and laws,<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> our beloved
and faithful, in the year of our Saviour 1446.</p>

<p>Here follow the names of the signataries. At the head the Papal
Nuncio, the Inquisitor-General, and Vicar of Bosnia. For the Greek
communion the Metropolitan of Dioclea, ‘patriarch of our realm,’ a
series of bishops and Minorite fathers, and the Vladikas of the Greek
rite. At the head of the lay vassals is the respectable and magnificent
Stépan, Duke of St. Sava, with his sons; our dear brother the Ban of
Jaycze, Radivoj Vladmirović Count and Judge of our Court, Stépan
Vlatković our councillor and Ban of Ussora, John Covačić, Voivode
of our parts of Dalmatia, Peter Paulović, Voivode of Glasinac, and
master of our dish-bearers,<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a> Paul Kubretić Voivode of Zvornik and
master of our cup-bearers, and ‘many other Voivodes of our kingdom
holding Voivodeships and honours.’</p>

</div>

<p>The cry is peace, and there is no peace! There is a
pathos in these short enactments—the voice of national
despair sounding faintly down the avenue of time.</p>

<p>The crops have already been trodden down beneath the
troops of Turkish horsemen. The foe is at the gates, and
anarchy and treason reign within. The discordant parties
and turbulent nobles seem at length to realise that Bosnia
must unite or perish. For a moment the bans forget<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span>
their mutual feuds, and the bishops of both churches
agree as brothers. Let the murderer no longer be unpunished;
let Holy Church no longer be robbed with
impunity; let the great barons of the land cease to disown
their fealty to their sovereign; let some restraint be
put upon the corruption of family life; let the coinage no
longer suffer debasement. The Grand Inquisitor himself
sets his seal to an act by which the hated Bogomiles are
accorded comparative toleration. But it is all too late.
Already the national treason shows symptoms of beginning,
and it is found necessary to insert a special enactment
against those betrayers of fenced cities. The impending
national catastrophe seems to overshadow this
High Court of Feudal Bosnia, just as even now in the
still evening air the shadows of yonder mountains are
creeping over the mosques and minarets of Coinica, and
spreading a pall over the tents which the Turkish soldiery
have pitched on the Bosnian bank.</p>

<p>One cannot wonder that Coinica was chosen as the
meeting-place of the lords spiritual and temporal of
Christian Bosnia. The situation on the one pass which
connects the heart of Bosnia and her present capital with
the duchy, and the magnificent bridge which here spans
the Narenta, make it the key to the Herzegovina; and
even the Turks have shown themselves so alive to its
strategic importance that on the outbreak of the insurrection
one of the first cares of the government was to
secure the position by posting here a division of troops,
whose tents we now descried on a height above the Narenta,
as—after a short and satisfactory audience with
the Kaïmakàm, whom we interviewed in a house which
he was building on the Bosnian shore—we crossed the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
bridge, and, entering Coinica, find ourselves in the old
duchy of St. Sava.</p>

<p>Here, after some difficulty, we have discovered a Han—or
rather a loft above a stable—and the attendance is
certainly in keeping with the place! We are waited on
by a turbaned youth, who is a very good specimen of the
untutored savage, as he exists in Bosnia at the present
day. He comes into our room and gapes at us while we
are eating; he takes up our scrap of wheaten bread—a
<i>bonne-bouche</i> which we had brought with us from Serajevo—and
fingers it complacently. When we ask for water,
this child of nature snatches up the pitcher, and before
handing it to us takes a good pull at the spout himself!
Since then he has stared at us persistently, with interludes
of spitting about the floor. We have hinted in every
possible way that he is <i>de trop</i>—but to hints our young
barbarian shows himself quite unapproachable—till at
last all our respect for the sanctity of a host fairly breaks
down, and we rid ourselves of our incubus by the magic
word <i>Haiti</i>!</p>

<p>Nature’s gentlemen the Bosniacs certainly are not!
There is not here that surviving polish of an older civilization—that
inheritance of refinement which one traces
amongst the Italian peasants, and which the traveller
meets with even among the Rouman shepherds of the Carpathian
wilds. The Bosniacs, on the contrary, show themselves
grossly familiar when not cowed into bearish reserve;
they have not even sufficient tact to perceive when
their impertinence or obtrusive curiosity is annoying.
They show no delicacy about prying into our effects,
and in this respect are far behind the Wallacks and
other uncivilized European populations with whom I have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
come in contact. They never displayed gratitude for any
small largess that we bestowed on them, though they
grabbed at it with avidity; and their general ingratitude
was confirmed by those who have had more experience
of the country. Amongst the Mahometan burghers there
certainly is a very considerable amount of politeness
and a natural dignity, due to the grand Oriental traditions
with which their conversion to Islâm has imbued
them, to which I willingly pay homage. But among
the Christians, even of the highest social strata, the want
of politeness and that ungenerous vice of mean spirits—ingratitude—are
simply astounding. It has already been
mentioned that when the new Serbian cathedral was
being built, the Russian government presented the Greek
congregation of Serajevo with a magnificent set of icons
and other church furniture. This costly gift was sent
carriage free as far as Brood; but from this town to Serajevo
the cost of transport, amounting to at most a dozen
or so ducats, fell on the Christian merchants of Serajevo,
who, on their own showing, are the wealthiest part of the
population of a large city. Will it be believed?—instead
of paying the money at once and with pleasure, they
entered a formal protest at the Russian Consulate against
defraying this trifling expense! The Russian Consul was
profoundly disgusted.</p>

<p>But I should be guilty of passing a very shallow
judgment on the sometimes too obtrusive familiarity of
these people if I did not point out that it is but an unpleasant
phase of what is really one of the most valuable
qualities preserved by the Bosnian people in the days of
bondage. It is part and parcel of a democratic habit of
mind common to the whole Serbian, and indeed the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
whole South-Sclavonic race. It is the representative in
conversation of those primitive social relations which hold
throughout all these lands within the common yard of the
house-community, and have survived alike the imported
feudalism of the Middle Ages, and the Turkish conquest.
In these Illyrian lands I have often been addressed as
‘<i>brat</i>,’ or brother, and the Bosniacs are known to call the
stranger ‘<i>shija</i>’—neighbour. I, who write this, happen
individually not to appreciate this ‘<i>égalitaire</i>’ spirit. I
don’t choose to be told by every barbarian I meet that he
is a man and a brother. I believe in the existence of
inferior races, and would like to see them exterminated.
But these are personal mislikings, and it is easy to see
how valuable such a spirit of democracy may be amongst a
people whose self-respect has been degraded by centuries
of oppression, and who in many respects are only too
prone to cower beneath the despot’s rod: for one need
not be enamoured of liberty coupled with equality and
fraternity not to perceive that, when the choice lies
between it and tyranny, freedom, even in such companionship,
is to be infinitely preferred; and a man must
be either blind or a diplomatist not to perceive that in
the Sclavonic provinces of Turkey the choice ultimately
lies between despotism and a democracy almost socialistic.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 27th.</i>—There was nothing to see in Coinica
except the bridge and a mosque or two, so we were again
on our way this morning, following the road along the
Narenta valley. The scenery much reminded us of the
valley of the Izonzo as you descend southwards across
the Julian Alps. The whiter and more barren rocks:
the signs of a more southern climate in the ripe grapes
and what vegetation there was, as well as in the intense<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
heat of the sun over our heads: the houses, no
longer of wood, but of white stone,<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> almost tower-like,
with high stone stairs outside—recalled one after the
other the metamorphoses which had struck us on a
former pilgrimage when emerging on the stifling valleys
of Gradisca from the Predil Pass. And assuredly the
Narenta flowing beside us was as emerald green in its
transparency as ever those Sontian pools which feasted
Dante’s eyes when the guest of Pagano della Torre. The
Narenta in its upper course is very dangerous to bathe in,
since the current is not only very rapid, but has short cuts
by underground caverns which form whirlpools not easy
to detect in the general turmoil of the surface waters, but
which are capable none the less of occasionally sucking
down into earth’s bowels some of the enormous trees
which are seen to float down this river. We, however,
discovered a safe and sheltered pool of this wonderful blue-emerald
purity, in which we disported ourselves while
the soup of our mid-day meal was brewing on the shore.</p>

<p>Towards evening, still following the road, we began
to leave the Narenta valley, and to cut off a great bend
of its course by zigzagging over some heights. Here we
passed some sick and wounded Turks <i>en route</i> from the
scene of war, and other soldiers with them, but our pass
again stood us in good stead. The heights above the road
looked more desolate than any we had seen, as the brushwood
had been set on fire, apparently to prevent the
enemy from advancing unperceived and perhaps surprising
a convoy, so that, as we passed, volumes of smoke
were rising above us from blackened thickets. From the
summit of this pass opened out a grand view of naked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
mountain peaks. Rapidly descending we came once more
upon the Narenta at a point where a party of Turks,
under the direction of a Belgian engineer, were using
their best endeavours to complete an iron bridge across
the river.</p>

<p>The Belgian engineer, who had been kindly told by
consular agency to look out for us, received us with open
arms, and hospitably offered us the shelter of his tent for
the night. He told us, as a good illustration of Turkish
<i>laisser-aller</i>, that the bridge, which had been brought here
at a large expense from England, had lain for two years
on the river bank without being set up. At last the outbreak
of the insurrection harshly aroused the authorities
to a sense of their negligence; and now the work has to
be pushed on with the greatest hurry imaginable, as the
bridge is becoming every day more indispensable for the
transport of cannon and other heavy munitions and
supplies into the Herzegovina. The workmen employed
are only Mahometans, but there are some booths hard-by
for the sale of raki and provisions, kept by a small
Christian colony. The Belgian himself lodged at the
Mahometan village of Jablanica, a little further down the
valley, whither we presently accompanied him to accept
of his hospitable shelter.</p>

<p>As we were walking towards this our engineer pointed
to a part of a maize-plot on the roadside to the right,
where the maize was slightly trodden down. ‘Do you
see that?’ he asked; ‘perhaps you would like to know
how the maize got trodden down there?’</p>

<p>He then recounted to us the following narrative,
which, coming from an eye-witness, served to enlighten
us considerably as to the amenities of Turkish rule.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span></p>

<p>It must be prefaced that at the present time no one
can go from one village to another without being provided
with a <i>teskeri</i> or Turkish pass, and that it was one
of the functions of the Belgian engineer, as head of the
Road Commission, to examine and set his <i>visé</i> on the
<i>teskeris</i> of all who passed along this road. A few days
ago a young Herzegovinian Christian—a fine young fellow,
according to the Belgian—stopped at his tent and showed
his pass, which proved to be quite <i>en règle</i>, and was
<i>visé’d</i> by the engineer accordingly. He then proceeded
on his way with a light heart, but as he was passing by
the booths which I have mentioned near the bridge, two
Turks—not officials or soldiers of any kind, but armed
nevertheless—came up and insolently demanded to see
his <i>teskeri</i>. This they had not a shadow of a right to
ask for; but the young fellow, knowing that in this
country might is right, did not hesitate to comply, and
handed his <i>teskeri</i> for their examination. Thereupon the
two Mahometans, who could not read a syllable, swore
that the whole thing was wrong, and seizing hold of the
young rayah began to drag him along, crying out to the
Christians at the booths that they were taking him off to
the Road Commission.</p>

<p>But they had not proceeded far when they suddenly
fell upon him, and hauling him off into the maize where
we had seen it trampled down, butchered him with seven
blows from their <i>handshars</i>, one of which half cut
through his neck. They then made off in broad daylight,
making their way through the Christians and others
whom the young fellow’s cries were bringing to the scene
of the tragedy—not a soul daring to lay a hand on the
murderers, who were also Turks! The Belgian, who was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
in his tent, had been also roused by a loud ‘<i>Homaum!
homaum!</i>’ as he expressed the cries, and coming out,
found the young rayah, who had succeeded in crawling
to the road, past human assistance.</p>

<p>The Belgian at once sent for Zaptiehs to arrest the
murderers; but by the time these functionaries were on
their way the birds were flown. At any rate they never
arrested them—but it is well known that Zaptiehs often
let felons escape on purpose, if they are true believers.</p>

<p>When I say that since this event the Belgian has been
in a state of painful agitation, I am but feebly expressing
the state of mind in which we found that unfortunate
official. His colleague, an Italian, has already made off—and
the poor man himself has been exercising his engineering
sagacity in planning the nearest route over the
mountains by which to escape to the Dalmatian frontier.
He had collected his effects, and was ready to start at a
moment’s notice. He thought he could reach the border
at the nearest point in ten hours. He was most afraid
of the Bosniac Mussulmans, and especially of the Bashi-Bazouks;
and when we suggested that he, being in the
Turkish service, ought at least to feel secure, he assured
us that this was not sufficient to restrain the fanaticism of
the native Moslems, who regard the office of an engineer
with pious horror, and curse the new-fangled iron bridge
whenever they pass it, as the devil’s handiwork! His
fears were so genuine that he dared not walk as far as
the bridge—just five minutes off—without an escort of
Zaptiehs!</p>

<p>The engineer’s funk, however, did not prevent him
from providing us with a most satisfactory repast, consisting
of <i>pili</i>, eggs, and fried slices of gourd, which are excellent.
He told us that had it been earlier in the summer<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
it would not have been safe to sleep in his tent, as this
spot, as well as the whole Narenta valley, is infested in
June with snakes and scorpions. During that month the
peasants dare not go about with bare feet, as they like to
do at other seasons; and indeed, though the dangerous
season has passed, we have noticed that the people about
here are more swathed as to their legs than ordinary
Bosniacs.</p>

<p><i>Aug. 28th.</i>—This morning our Belgian, who was
hardly reassured by the news which we brought from
Serajevo, has suddenly discovered that he has a pressing
engagement at Trieste—to meet his mother—and hands
us a letter to the Vali demanding ‘a temporary leave of
absence’—his sole object of course being to visit the old
lady. We were much touched by this display of filial
affection.</p>

<p>The heat being again cruel, we secured the luxury of
a horse to carry our knapsacks to Mostar, the destination
of our to-day’s trudge; and, while waiting for the due
equipment of our beast in the yard of our Mahometan
<i>Kiradjì</i> or driver, we have leisure to observe a most
curious phenomenon in the costume of the female Moslems
of this district. In every other part of Bosnia and the
Herzegovina the veil is <i>de rigueur</i> with the wives and
mothers of the faithful. But here at Jablanica, and in
this part of the valley of the Narenta on both sides of the
spot where the little river Rama<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> debouches into it, the
Mahometan women discard their <i>yashmak</i><a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> with one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
accord, and not only show themselves before strangers
of the other sex bare-faced, but do not blush to hold
converse with them. It is true that even here they
display on occasion a certain shyness of male regards;
and the Belgian warned us that, if looked at too curiously,
they did not confine themselves to a prudish <i>Haiti!</i> but
were known to vindicate their modesty with a volley of
stones. We, however, were never saluted after this
fashion, the fair Mahometans contenting themselves at
most with turning away their faces from the passing
Giaour.</p>

<p>But while waiting in our Kiradjì’s yard, we were
treated with far greater condescension by the womankind
of his family. The yard itself was very unlike the stockaded
prison-court of our earlier Bosnian experiences.
Here, instead of the tall palisade which as a rule so effectively
screens the members of the harem from the public
gaze, was simply a low stone wall; and while we were
contemplating the dwelling-house, built, like the yard
wall, of the rough limestone of the country, and admiring
the elegant ogival windows, out came an old Mahometan
dame and two younger women—the mother, we
conjectured, and two daughters of the house—and calmly
took stock of us with faces unveiled, and without the
slightest sign of bashfulness. They smiled, and we smiled,
and though our stock of Bosniac was limited, we made
ourselves intelligible to one another by means of the universal
language of signs, and in this fashion carried on a
very edifying conversation. As the old lady was particularly
desirous of trying on our spectacles, we hastened to
gratify her wishes; and as we were particularly anxious
to see the carnelian and other rings of virtue that adorned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319"></a>[319]</span>
their fair fingers, they obligingly held out their hands
for our perusal. We were pleased to see the finger-nails
of these would-be <i>Houris</i> stained with rosy henna—a
fond reminiscence of the wings, which, as every true-believer
knows, Eve lost little by little when driven forth
beyond the gate of Paradise. Here, at last, we have
Darwin defeated on his own ground! Preposterous to
suppose that these who still show traces of the rainbow
plumes wherewith their first angelic fore-mother was
wont to flutter—that these <i>Rhododactyls</i>—should be
great granddaughters of hirsute gibberers!</p>

<p>From the waistband of these dutiful daughters of Eve
knives and keys were suspended by a short string, on
which were strung a variety of quaint objects, which we
were gracefully accorded permission to examine more
closely. They proved to be a selection of large beads of
antique fabric—some apparently Venetian, one certainly
Roman; and intermixed with these were the vertebræ of
some small animal—possibly worn as amulets.</p>

<p>The clasp-knife itself, or <i>Britva</i> as it is called,
attached to this chatelaine, is an interesting feature of
the national costume of Serbian women. These are sometimes
of the most gorgeous workmanship, inlaid with gold
and mother-of-pearl, and are alluded to in the popular
poetry.</p>

<p>Thus in the tragic poem entitled ‘The Stepsisters,’
which Sir John Bowring has translated, Paul arouses the
jealousy of his wife by presenting his sister Jélitza with</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent16">A knife, in silver hafted,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And adorned with gold.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Thereupon Paul’s young wife resolves to ruin Jélitza.
She slays her husband’s black courser and his grey falcon,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320"></a>[320]</span>
and accuses her stepsister of the deeds. Jélitza, however,
both times succeeds in persuading Paul of her innocence,
and Paul’s wife must resort to a yet blacker crime. One
fine evening she steals away her stepsister’s knife, and slays
with it her own and Paul’s baby. At early dawn she
rouses her husband, tearing her cheeks, and shrieking in
his ear,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Evil is the love thou bear’st thy sister,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And thy gifts to her are more than wasted:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She has stabbed our infant in the cradle!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Paul rushes to his sister’s chamber ‘like one possessed by
madness;’ finds ‘the golden knife beneath her pillow.’
‘It was damp with blood—’twas red and gory!’ Poor
Jélitza, protesting in vain her innocence, is tied by her
infuriated brother to the tails of four wild horses.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">But where’er a drop of blood fell from her</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There a flower sprang up—a fragrant flow’ret—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where her body fell when dead and mangled,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">There a church arose from out the desert.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Meanwhile a curse lay on the murderess—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">Little time was spent, ere fatal sickness</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">’Midst her bones the matted dog-grass sprouted,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And amidst it nestled angry serpents.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which, though hidden, drank her eye-light’s brightness.</div>
  </div>

</div>

<p class="noindent">In vain she seeks to shrive herself in her sister’s church.
A mysterious voice arrests her at the portal, and warns
her from the spot, ‘for this church can neither heal nor
save thee.’ In her agony she implores her husband to
bind <i>her</i> too ‘to the wild steeds’ tails, and drive them—drive
them to th’ immeasurable desert!’ Paul listens to
her entreaties, and binding her to the wild steeds’ tails,
‘drove them forth across the mighty desert.’ But—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321"></a>[321]</span></p>

<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">

    <div class="verse indent0">On its throat the white hand of its mother:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And that hand a golden knife was holding.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The knives, however, of our friendly family were not
of such costly material, the crescent-shaped handle being
simply of horn studded with brass bosses. Of other ornaments
they displayed on their girdle the usual twin
circular brooches, and on their hair an array of gilt coins.
Their dress in many respects much resembled that of the
rayah women, for they wore the two characteristic aprons;
their heads were coiffed with the same light kerchiefs;
and one woman whom we met on the road had this head-dress
arranged with a flowing white tassel gracefully depending
at the side, in the same fashion as the Latin
Christian maiden of the Possávina, whose portrait has
already been given.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> But further description of our unveiled
Mahometans is needless, as their complaisance was
such that they allowed me even to sketch them.</p>

<p>But, one naturally asks, how came these Moslem
dames and maidens to go about unveiled in this single
district of a country where the injunctions of the Koràn
in this respect are usually carried out to the letter? I do
not think that anyone who surveys the naked rocks that
tower above this part of the Narenta valley—who marks
the dearth of pasture for cattle, and who realizes how
little land there is for cultivation even beside the streams—can
be long in doubt as to the true cause of this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
omission. Here there is a lawgiver more exacting of obedience
than the Prophet himself. Amidst this limestone
wilderness Nature reigns supreme, and will be obeyed. A
voice that cannot be mistaken bids women as well as men
go forth to their work and to their labour until the evening.
All hands are needed to stave off starvation, and it is
essential to the women that they should have the free use
of eyes and limbs to aid their brothers, husbands, and
fathers. The struggle for existence is too hard to admit
of any of the combatants cumbering themselves with the
impedimenta of any ceremonial law whatsoever. ’Tis the
pitiless clutch of hunger that has dragged even the Moslem
women from the seclusion of the harem; and they have
cast away their veils and swaddling-clothes that they may
glean a bare subsistence in the desert!</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp67" id="illus46" style="max-width: 28.125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus46.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Unveiled Mahometan Women at Jablanica.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span></p>

<p>Perhaps the absence of veils may be partly due to the
influence of the surrounding population, which is mainly
Christian. In any case it would probably be more accurate
to say that the Mahometans of this district were incapacitated
by their surroundings from ever taking the veil of
Islâm, rather than that they threw it off after assuming it;
and to look on their present costume rather as an old
Bosnian relic which has survived their renegation of
Christianity. But this does not make the assertion less
true, that the inexorable code of Nature has here over-ridden

<p>But we are once more on our way, and as we descend
the Narenta valley, about an hour from Jablanica, the
mountains close in upon us and scenery of the most
stupendous character engrosses our attention. The view
at this point is recognised as the most magnificent in the
whole of Bosnia. The road itself<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> is hewn out along the
face of a precipice, and the magnesian-limestone and
dolomitic cliffs on either side of the gorge rise in places
three thousand feet<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> sheer above the Narenta, which,
chafing and foaming, hurries passionately through the
narrow mountain portal below. The whole was seen at a
time of day when everything looks most fresh and lovely,
lit up with the slanting rays of the rising sun, throwing
into alto relievo the vast rock-sculptures of Nature, and
glorifying her heroic forms. Above, peak after peak of
topaz stood out against the pale azure of this cloudless
Southern sky; but no intrusive shaft of gold—even from
a Phœbean quiver—could penetrate the twilight of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span>
gorge itself. Here all was softened into a pervading lilac,
veined with an intenser purple by infinite striations of
strata, till the bare mountain-walls—bathed in this floating
light—seemed to be hewn out of amethystine agate,
and afforded the most exquisite contrasts to the liquid
emerald of the river below. The cliffs along whose surface
we were now making our way were veiled in darker
shadow, snow-white against which expanded a living fan
of feathery spray from a stream that gushed forth in full
volume, and of glacier coolness, from a cavern in the rock.</p>

<p>We crossed over to the left steep of the river by an
iron bridge—another English importation—and for many
hours were still threading this wondrous pass. We had
indeed passed the <i>Iron Gates</i> of the Narenta, but there
was still much to admire in the scenery. The high mountains
continued, though they ceased to frown abruptly
over the river. Lean naked giants they were: ribbed
skeletons, thinly clad with stunted foliage, though in
places still yellow with dwarf laburnum shrubs. The
rocks were perpetually starting up into castles and towers,
sometimes a quaint mediæval castle suggesting a background
of Albert Dürer, but oftener more Roman in their
architecture; towers, square and round, which from the
narrow horizontal laminations of the rocks reproduced
with surprising exactness the appearance of ruined masonry,
and rugged lines of ancient brickwork that called
up visions of the time-scarred walls of Anderida. About
these ruins of an older world clustered, in place of ivy,
the tender sprays of wild vine laden with unripe beads,
or here and there a beautiful bind-weed with capacious
chalices of pink, as large as Convolvulus major.</p>

<p>As we descended further down the pass, the rocks assumed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
a glaring chalky whiteness—rather painful to the
eyes—but like most things in nature, not without redeeming
effects peculiar to itself. Perhaps, too, it was artistically
right that everything around should become barer
and plainer, that nothing might distract the eye from enjoying
the marvellous beauties of the river. This was
always the same liquid emerald, mottled with snow-white
foam, and shading off into it, as when the gem, it imitated
so well, freezes into its quartzite roots. Now and again
the river would plunge into a deep circling pool—forming
a dark blue-emerald eye, which paling off among the
golden pebbles of the shallows, looked like nothing but
some gorgeous peacock’s plume modulating its rainbow
colours in the breeze.</p>

<p>Everything around us began to betoken a more Southern
climate—the heat was almost tropical, and a lurid
haze covered the whole face of the land. On the rocks
grew pink cyclamen and a beautiful purple salvia;
amongst the trees were Spanish chestnuts and wild figs,
and nearer Mostar fine rosy pomegranates, which look
like quinces blushing at their monstrosity, and grow on
a shrub that reminded us of a homely privet. In the
gardens of the few stone cots we saw are delicious ripe
grapes and golden figs, and we began to understand why
it is that the Herzegovinian contemptuously calls his
Bosnian brothers <i>Slivari</i>, ‘munchers of plums!’</p>

<p>About two hours and a half from Mostar the pass opened,
and our way lay across a broader part of the Narenta
valley, overlooked by the mountains at a more respectful
distance. Here, passing a cottage, we noticed the poles
of the fence that surrounded the adjoining maize-field
adorned with an array of equine skulls. I cannot doubt
that these were set up for the same reason as induced the
ancients to set up the skulls of cattle among their corn-fields—namely,
as an amulet against blight.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a> The superstition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327"></a>[327]</span>
survived in mediæval Italy, and Boccaccio tells an
amusing story of a lady who, by turning the two asses’
skulls on her garden fence in a certain direction, telegraphed
to her lover that her husband was out.</p>

<p>At a solitary hut called Potoci, about two hours
distant from Mostar, we took leave of our Kiradjì, who
would not trust his beast any further, since any horse
that showed itself in the neighbourhood of the Herzegovinian
capital was sure to be requisitioned. Opposite
the hovel at Potoci was a small stone building, which, on
enquiry, we found to be a church. It laid no more claim
to architectural elegance than a barn, and, with its loop-holed
windows, and even these hermetically boarded up,
and a door carefully barred, seemed at present more
fitted for withstanding a siege than for the celebration of
divine service. Perchance, in these troubled times, the
congregation preferred to seek the high places of nature
for their worship. Indeed, whilst passing through the
more precipitous gorge of the Narenta, we had caught
the solemn cadence of a Christian hymn, chanted, may
be, by some shepherd on the mountain side; but whoever
poured forth the ‘plaintive anthem’ was hidden by
distance and intervening rocks from our view; nor were
the tones the less impressive that their rudeness was thus
softened, and that the singer was ‘but an invisible thing,
a voice, a mystery.’</p>

<p>The minarets of Mostar now rose before us, the city
lying on the Narenta at a point where the mountains on
each side again jut forward and overhang the river. To
the south of this the valley expands once more, so that
Mostar owes much of its importance to the fact that it is
the key to the communication between the upper and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span>
lower valleys of the Narenta; or, to take a simile from
the insect world, this city lies on the narrow duct—the
wasp’s waist—between the thorax and abdomen of the
river-system. We now made our way to the chief inn,
quite an imposing stone edifice, rejoicing in the title of
the Casino, and kept by an Italian Dalmatian on what he
is pleased to suppose European principles. Our room, at
all events, possessed the first beds<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> that we had seen
since we quitted Serajevo, and is further adorned with
a picture of the <i>Imperatore e Rè</i>. Here we were presently
visited by our Consul, Mr. Holmes, who is lodging
under the same roof, but had been out when we arrived,
engaged in relieving the tedium of diplomacy by practising
a still more gentle craft on the banks of the
Narenta, which is a fine trout-stream.</p>

<p>From Mr. Holmes we learnt the official Turkish
account of the Herzegovinian insurrection—or rather the
official account as served up to suit <i>English</i> palates; for,
as was discovered by the consular body on afterwards
comparing notes, the wily Governor-General gave a different
version of the story to each of the European
Consuls!</p>

<p>According to <i>our</i> version the whole affair was concocted
by about forty agitators, and these not even Herzegovinians
for the most part, but Montenegrines and
Dalmatians. Certainly, even the Vali allowed, the tax-farming
was a grievance—and who more laudably desirous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span>
of removing it than he (the Pashà) himself?—but
that, so far as the present rising was concerned, it had not
even this ground of justification. That the misguided
beings who answered to the summons of the professional
agitators were what are called Pandours, somewhat corresponding
to the Austrian <i>Grenzers</i>, who, in return for
frontier defence, are freed from ordinary taxes, and who,
so far from being ruined by the tax-farmers, are actually
in receipt of a small sum annually from the Government.
Well, yes, there certainly have been some complaints of
misgovernment, and the Pashà, always desirous that the
meanest of his (the Sultan’s) subjects should share in the
fullest measure the beneficence of his lieutenant’s rule,
had sent two Commissioners, the Mutasarìf of Mostar and
a respectable <i>Christian</i> of Serajevo, Constant Effendi, to
inquire into the alleged grievances. But what did these
Commissioners report? Just complaints they could hear
absolutely none. Thread-bare grievances, often as much
as ten years old, were raked up for their benefit, and
even these were retailed, not by the alleged victims or
their families, but by self-constituted grief-mongers!
True, it might be objected that if the insurrection was
altogether devoid of just cause, how was its spread to
be accounted for? but, really, the explanation was very
simple. These frontier agitators, not meeting with sympathy
from the loyal Christian subjects of the Sultan,
supplied its want by intimidation. That in many cases
the Turkish authorities had received messages from
Christian villages saying ‘We do not wish to join the
insurrection, but we fear that we shall be forced to join.’
And forced to join they were. If a village refused to
throw in its lot with the rebels, they first burnt one house<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
or one maize-plot, and then another, till the unhappy
villagers, forced to choose between ruin and rebellion,
consented to join their ranks. As to the way in which
the insurgents were conducting the war, it was almost
too horrible to be repeated. That they would often shut
up whole families of Moslems in their houses, to which
they then set fire. That, (to take a single instance,) at
Ljubinje they spitted two children and roasted them alive
before their parents’ eyes. And while relating these and
other atrocities to our Consul, the tender-hearted Pashà
burst into tears. The tears were, I believe, exclusively
reserved for <i>our</i> representative—a distinguished mark of
confidence.</p>

<p>Dervish Pashà has a well-earned reputation for <i>finesse</i>,
but this account of the outbreak can hardly claim even
the qualified merit of being <i>ben trovato</i>! The authentic
history, as elicited by the Consular Commission of the
great Powers,<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> shows very few features in common with
this official Turkish explanation. To begin with, however
credible may seem the statement that the Turkish
governors of the Herzegovina are in the habit of paying
Christians to defend their frontier, and whatever sums
the Pandours may have been in the habit of receiving
from a government on the verge of bankruptcy, these
considerations are beside the point, for the focus of the
whole movement has been the village of Nevešinje, not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331"></a>[331]</span>
on the frontier at all, but, on the contrary, in the heart of
the country, only a few miles from Mostar itself.</p>

<p>As in Bosnia, the main cause of the insurrection was
the oppression of the tithe-farmers. The case of the
Herzegovinian rayahs differs, however, in many respects
from that of their Bosnian brothers. This is due to the
difference in the physical conditions of the two countries.
In Bosnia there are many tracts, like the Possávina, of
marvellous fertility, where the most extortionate government
cannot so entirely consume the fatness of the land
as not to leave the rayah considerable gleanings. Far
otherwise is the case in the Herzegovina. The greater
part of this country may be briefly described as a limestone
desert, and it is the terrible poverty of the soil
which makes the position of its Christian tiller so unendurable.</p>

<p>Here, too, the chief product of the earth is not maize,
but tobacco and grapes, and the peculiar character of these
crops enables the government to extort a double impost
on each. For the tobacco as it stands on the ground, and
for the grapes when carried off as must, the tithe-farmers
exacts his eighth in his usual arbitrary fashion.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a>
But now follows a supplementary extortion. On what
remains to the rayah, after paying these eighths, he has
to pay <i>giumruk</i>, or excise. This, like the former tax, is
let out to ‘publicans’ as villanous as the other tithe-farmers,
whom they rival in their extortions. They swoop
down on an unfortunate village with their gang of retainers
and Zaptiehs, and live at free quarters on the
villagers. Their business is to find out the quantity of
tobacco still growing on the stalk, and the remnant of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
wine drawn from the must which has escaped the collector
of ‘the eighth;’ and their exactions and insolence
are among the grievances on which the insurgents in their
appeal to the foreign Consuls lay most stress.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> These
men hold an inquisition on every hearth, and the right
which they exercise of intruding themselves into the inmost
privacy of the rayah gives them inconceivable
opportunities for outrage.</p>

<p>Another of the special evils of the Herzegovina is also
in a great measure due to the physical aspect of the
country. This is eminently a peak-land. The mountains
here are higher than in Bosnia, and the strongholds of the
old feudal nobility consequently more impregnable. In
Bosnia the native Agas and Begs have been to a certain
extent brought under the central government. But in the
Herzegovina their authority retains much more of its old
vitality. Here the wretched rayah has not only to satisfy
the Kaïmakàms and Mutasarìfs, who represent the needs
of the Osmanlì ruler, but is at the mercy of a haughty
aristocratic caste, who eye their Christian serfs with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
contempt of a feudal lord for a <i>villain</i>, and the abhorrence
of a fanatical Moslem for a Giaour.</p>

<p>Suffering from this double disability, social and religious,
the Christian ‘<i>kmet</i>,’ or tiller of the soil, is worse
off than many a serf in our darkest ages, and lies as
completely at the mercy of the Mahometan owner of the
soil as if he were a slave. Legally, indeed, the Aga who
owns all the land is bound to enter into a written agreement
with his ‘<i>kmet</i>’ as to the dues and labours to be paid him;
but as a matter of fact this petty potentate haughtily refuses
to enter into any such compact; and since the Turkish
government knows well enough that its tenure of the Herzegovina
is not worth twenty-four hours’ purchase if it were
seriously to act counter to the native Sclavonic Mahometans,
the Beg or Aga can break the law with impunity. He is thus
allowed to treat his ‘<i>kmet</i>’ as a mere chattel; ‘he uses a
stick and strikes the “<i>kmet</i>” without pity, in a manner
that no one else would use a beast.’ Any land that the
rayah may acquire, any house he may have built, any
patch of garden that his industry may have cleared
among the rocks, the Aga seizes at his pleasure. The
ordinary dues, as paid by the kmet to the landowner,
as specified in the appeal of the Herzegovinian rayahs, are
heavy enough. He has to pay, according to the custom
of the various districts, a third or a fourth part of the
produce of the ground, about Mostar and the Plain of
Popovo as much as half;<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> to present him with one animal
yearly, and a certain quantity of butter and cheese; to
carry for him so many loads of wood; and if the Aga is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>
building a house, to carry the materials for it; to work
for him gratuitously whenever he pleases, and sometimes
the Aga requisitions one of the kmet’s children, who must
serve him for nothing; to make a separate plantation
of tobacco, cultivate it, and finally warehouse the produce
in his master’s store; and to plough and sow so many acres
of land, the harvest of which he must also carry to his
master’s barn. Finally, to lodge the Aga in his own house
when required, and to provide for his horses and dogs.</p>

<p>The insurrection in the Herzegovina has been directed
more against the Mahometan landowners and the
tax-farmers than against the immediate representatives of
the Sultan. It is mainly an agrarian war.</p>

<p>Add to the extortion of the tax-farmers and landlords,
the forced labour which the government officials exact as
well as the Agas, the impossibility of obtaining justice in
the Medjliss, the atrocious conduct of the brigand-police or
Zaptiehs, and, of course, the wolfish propensities of the
shepherd of the herd—the Fanariote bishop of Mostar—and
we have more than enough to account for the outbreak
of the insurrection without going in quest of
foreign agitators.</p>

<p>This is not to deny that the insurrection was aided
and abetted by Sclavonic agitators from beyond the
border. The solidarity between the various members
of the South-Sclavonic race has, as we heard from the
most well-informed sources, reached a pitch which demands
an attention that it has not received from the
statesmen of this country. It was inevitable that the
Sclaves beyond the Turkish border should sympathize
with their oppressed brothers in their struggle for liberty,
and should aid them with supplies and recruits. Thus<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
there are many representatives of all the South-Sclavonic
peoples from Bohemia to Montenegro fighting in the
insurgent ranks,<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a>
    and one of their principal leaders, Ljubibratić,<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a>
comes from Free Serbia. But that the insurrection
was brought about by foreign agitators is strongly
disproved by the fact that the outbreak took the Serbian
Revolutionary Society—the <i>Omladina</i> itself—by surprise.</p>

<p>But, it will be asked, have the Sclavonic committees
and societies, partly literary partly political, established
for years at different towns along the Dalmatian and
Croatian frontiers, effected nothing? It stands to reason
that they have played their part in preparing the rayah
for the present outbreak. To their influence, no doubt,
is due the fact that among the Christians of several parts
of the Herzegovina, including the districts where the
revolt first broke out, a defence organization had already
been set on foot. The rayahs of every village, who in
case of extreme oppression were ready to take arms, had
divided themselves into groups of twenty or thirty called
<i>Čotas</i>, under a leader whose title was <i>Načenik</i>. When,
however, we come to enquire what induced the rayahs
to put a halter round their necks by listening to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span>
advice of their free brothers beyond the border, and
organizing such measures of protection; when we come
to enquire what at last induced them to take up arms—then
there is only one ever-recurring answer—it was
simply and solely the tyranny of the agents of the Turkish
government and the Mahometan landlords.</p>

<p>Nothing shows a more hopelessly wrong conception
of the whole character of the rayah mind, than to suppose
that the dull, unlettered peasants of Bosnia and
Herzegovina took up arms as the champions of Panslavism
or the ‘Cosmopolitan Revolution.’ Jacques Bonhomme,
of whatever nationality, is an emphatically practical
being, and a <i>grande idée</i> is entirely beyond his comprehension.
Poor Herzegovinian Hodge did not exchange
his spade for a musket to secure Provincial Autonomy;
he simply wanted to obtain a fair share of what he earned
with the sweat of his brow, to gain security for life and
limb and the honour of his wife and children, to be
allowed at least to live. How far, since the date of the
first outbreak, foreign auxiliaries and emissaries may have
succeeded in infusing the refinements of <i>la haute politique</i>
into this raw material, is beyond my province to enquire.
All that I wish to point out is that this insurrection—so
pregnant in its consequences—was in its origin Agrarian
rather than Political. It was largely an affair of tenant-right.</p>

<p>The outbreak of the insurrection was certainly
favoured by a variety of accidental circumstances. The
visit of the Emperor of Austria to Dalmatia in the spring
could not fail to raise hopes of Austrian intervention,
and Christians of both sects did their best to lay petitions
before his Apostolic Majesty. The dispute between<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span>
Turkey and Montenegro with reference to the Podgorica
affair, induced the malcontents of the Herzegovina to look
with confidence for allies among their brothers of the
Black Mountain. Another favourable circumstance was
the discontent of the Franciscan fraternities, due to the
recent infringement of some of their privileges and the
delay of the Sultan in confirming their firmans, which
made the leaders of the Roman Catholic communion
willing to throw in their cause for the nonce with the
Greek heretics. One of the most curious features of the
present insurrection has been the way in which the two
Christian sects have fought side by side.<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a></p>

<p>The scene of the first outbreak was the district of
Nevešinje; and the history of the oppression there may
serve to explain the causes of discontent among the
rayah population of Herzegovina generally. The village
of Nevešinje, which gives its name to the surrounding
district, is about twelve miles distant from Mostar, as the
crow flies, and lies on the south-eastern flank of the
mountain range that rises above this city to the east. It
is built on the skirts of an extensive plain, raised 1,800
feet above sea level, and once the bed of a large lake,
known as the Nevešinsko Polje, and overlooked on
every side by a wilderness of bare limestone mountains
scattered with fragments of rock. In a rock-fastness like
this, little harvest could be expected in the best of
seasons, but in 1874 the harvest proved a failure altogether.
Yet, what there was might not be gathered in
till the tax-gatherer had claimed his eighth, and as he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>
did not make his appearance, it was allowed to rot on the
ground, till the starving peasantry could endure no longer
and cut a portion of it for their needs. Months passed,
and it was not till January 1875 (I am following the
consular report) that the tax-farmers at last made their
appearance, resolved to exact the uttermost farthing.
The Publicans on this occasion consisted of one Christian
and two members of the renegade Mahometan aristocracy
of the Herzegovina, who here vie with the Fanariote
Greeks for this shameful office. These gentry, as is their
wont, rated the harvest at far higher than its real value,
and when the peasants refused to comply with their exorbitant
demands, let loose their bloodhounds, the Zaptiehs,
and robbed, beat, and imprisoned whom they would.
The <i>Knezes</i> or village elders tried to complain to the
Kaïmakàm, but being insulted and threatened with imprisonment,
fled to Montenegro. The rest of the villagers,
unable to obtain any redress, and hourly subjected to the
violence of the Zaptiehs, took refuge, with their cattle, in
the neighbouring mountains. Only one old man was left
in the village, and him the Zaptiehs bound and sent to
Mostar. Events of a similar character were occurring in
the neighbouring districts.</p>

<p>But meanwhile the news of these events began to be
noised abroad. Unpleasant rumours of sacked villages
had reached the ears of the consular body, and the
Nevešinjans had even attempted to tell the story of their
wrongs to the Emperor of Austria, then engaged in his
Dalmatian journey. The Vali of Bosnia began to perceive
that it was high time for him to interfere, or the agitation
might reach such dimensions as to place him himself
in a difficult position. The oppressed rayahs of Nevešinje<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
and the surrounding districts had appealed to the
commiseration of civilized Europe, and something must
be done to satisfy the great Powers and their representatives,
and at the same time to allay the agitation among
the rayahs.</p>

<p>The Vali accordingly appointed the precious Commission,
already spoken of, to confer with the Christians
on their grievances; and at the same time gave the
refugees in Montenegro a safe-conduct to their homes.
By these means the Vali secured the double object of
revenging himself on the Christian refugees, and throwing
dust into the eyes of the consular body. The refugees, on
attempting to return, were, in spite of their safe-conduct,
fired on by Turkish troops; and when at last some of
them succeeded in finding their way to Nevešinje, the
Turkish authorities permitted Mussulmans of the village
to murder several without moving a finger to punish the
assassins! The results of the Commission were so falsified
as to make it appear that the whole agitation among the
rayahs was fictitious, and the outrages committed during
the last three months by tax-farmers and Zaptiehs, the
sack of whole villages, the assassination of men, the violation
of women, were, forsooth, reduced to ‘antiquated
grievances raked up by self-constituted grief-mongers.’</p>

<p>This might do all very well, so the Vali thought, for
the consular body; but he was well aware that other
tactics were necessary in order to allay the dangerous
spirit aroused among the rayah population. The shooting
of the refugees was due, he explained, to a ‘misunderstanding.’
The Christians were to be convinced of the
reality of the Commission. The Turkish government even
consented to place among its members the envoy of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_340"></a>[340]</span>
Prince of Montenegro. The real information received by
the Commission was very different from that which the
Vali vouchsafed to our Consul. The grievances of the
Herzegovinians generally, as against the government, are
well set forth in the seven demands which the people of
Nevešinje laid before the Commission. They form an
interesting commentary on the Turkish rule in the Herzegovina,
and savour neither of Panslavism nor of disloyalty
to the Sultan.</p>

<p>The demands of the men of Nevešinje were as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. That Christian girls and women should no longer be molested
by the Turks.</p>

<p>2. That their churches should no longer be desecrated, and that
free exercise of their religion should be accorded them.</p>

<p>3. That they should have equal rights with the Turks before the
law.</p>

<p>4. That they should be protected from the violence of the Zaptiehs.</p>

<p>5. That the tithe-farmers should take no more than they were
legally entitled to, and that they should take it at the proper time.</p>

<p>6. That every house should pay in all only one ducat a year.</p>

<p>7. That no forced labour, either personal or by horses, should be
demanded by the government; but that labour, when needed, should
be paid for, as was the case all over the world.</p>

</div>

<p>The last two demands were added on Dervish Pashà
himself appearing at Nevešinje; the Pashà promised that
he would do all in his power to satisfy their demands,
but that they must first lay down their arms. This, the
Christians, who as yet had committed no overt act of
hostility, expressed themselves ready to do, if the Pashà
would first find means to protect them from the armed
Mahometan fanatics by whom they saw themselves surrounded.
This the Vali either could not or would not
do, and on his departure the Christians, alarmed by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
hostile attitude of the native Mahometans, fled once more
to the mountains.</p>

<p>The weakness of the government now became deplorably
evident. The native Mussulmans, headed by a
Beg, a great landowner of the neighbourhood, who was
also one of the tithe-farmers, broke into the government
store and armed themselves with breech-loaders;
and on the 1st of July the civil war in the Herzegovina
was begun, not by the Christians, but by Mussulman fanatics,
who butchered all the Christians they could find in
Nevešinje—a few sick rayahs, who, unable to support the
hardships of mountain-life, had returned to their homes.</p>

<p>The Christian refugees now descended from the mountains
to retaliate on the perpetrators of the massacre;
whereupon the government, instead of interfering in an
impartial spirit to stop the disturbances and punish the
malefactors, dispatched two battalions of Turkish troops
to aid the Mahometan assassins, and attack the Christians
indiscriminately. It was now that the rayahs of the neighbouring
districts, who had been suffering from the same
outrages, answered the urgent appeal of the men of Nevešinje,
and a great part of the Christian population, from
the Roman Catholic districts of the right bank of the
Narenta to the orthodox Greek clans of the Montenegrine
border, flew to arms.</p>

<p>Since then a guerilla warfare has been carried on
among the mountains with uncertain results, but with
great atrocity on both sides. In such matters religion
counts for little, human nature for everything; and there
seems no good reason <i>a priori</i> for doubting the worst
instances of Christian atrocity that we heard of. But
granting that the Christians were guilty, as our Consul<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span>
asseverated, of the terrible <i>auto da fè</i> of Ljubinje, the
blame must be laid at the door, not of the poor wretches
who perpetrated these enormities, but of the tyrants who
have brutalized them for centuries; just as the worst
horrors of the French Revolution were but a counter-stroke
to the accumulated misdeeds of the despotism that
had preceded it. It is also true that the rayahs have in
some instances forced Christian villages to join their cause
by burning the crops and houses of the recalcitrants; but
if desperate men, standing at bay against overwhelming
numbers, have been forced to seek recruits by this means,
it is that long-continued tyranny has enslaved the very
spirit of many Christians. As with the miserable provincials
of the Roman empire, who saw themselves annually
pillaged by barbarian invaders, it was not that
injuries were wanting which should have urged freemen
to take up arms, but that the sense of injury itself—the last
relic of self-respect—had been deadened within them:—</p>

<p><i>Aug. 29th.</i>—Dervish Pashà, the Vali, or Governor-General,
of Bosnia, who has lately taken command of the
troops in Herzegovina in person, returned here last night
from Stolac, where he has been superintending operations
against the insurgents. Our Consul, who visited him this
morning, found him, outwardly at all events, well satisfied<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span>
with the results of his campaign. He is certainly the
most likely man to succeed against the insurgents, for not
only is he by repute one of the best generals that Turkey
possesses, but he is also well acquainted with the topography
of the Herzegovina, and already, as far back as
1851, distinguished himself in the guerilla warfare in
this country on the occasion of the last struggle of the
native Mahometan aristocracy against the Sultan. His
plan of operations in the present campaign has been to
occupy the valleys with large bodies of regular troops,
then, to draw the mountains with light-armed detachments,
and so to drive the game. But to occupy the
valleys and passes efficiently a body of troops is required
out of all proportion to the number of the insurgents; and
so, although Bosnia has been drained of troops for this
purpose, and 6,000 regulars have already been landed at
the port of Klek without hindrance from the Austrian
government, the Vali still complains that his force is insufficient,
and that the insurgents are perpetually escaping
out of the toils prepared for them and doubling on their
pursuers. He is, however, so well contented with the
result of his operations that he was about to start for
Tašlidzje and Novipazar in Rascia, where the insurrection
seemed to be attaining dangerous dimensions, and where
the commander was altogether incompetent.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> To-day
he sends three divisions of regulars to Stolac, Ljubinje,
and Nevešinje.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter with regard to the insurrection<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span>
here seems to be that neither party have gained any substantial
advantage. The insurgents have burnt several
block-houses along the Montenegrine frontier, and seized
some stores. On the other hand, the Turkish garrisons
have generally succeeded in making their escape, and the
insurgents have never succeeded in capturing any considerable
town, the Mahometan element being strong
among the urban population here as in Bosnia. News,
however, of a substantial success for the Turks arrives
from Bosnia. The Vali has just received a telegram to
say that the insurgents in the neighbourhood of Gradisca
have been beaten across the Save, and that the rebellion in
the Possávina has been virtually got under.</p>

<p>This morning our Consul kindly secured us an interview
with the Vali, and deputed his Cavass to guide us
to his Excellency’s Konak. We approached the official
residence through a yard in which there were cannons
and other warlike material, and making our way up a
flight of rickety wooden steps, and thence along a carpeted
corridor, were finally ushered by a gorgeous official into
the hall of state—an airy chamber, about which the
swallows were darting to and fro—in the extreme corner
of which sat the Pashà, who graciously rose to receive
us and shook hands. We were next treated to the usual
coffee, while his Excellency conversed with us by means
of a French interpreter. Our conversation was naturally
of a personal and not a political character, so that I may
confine myself to recording the amusement evinced by
the Vali on our praising the scenery of the Narenta
Valley. The beauty of mountain scenery was an aspect
of the outside world which had evidently never even
suggested itself to his mind, and it tickled his fancy immensely.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span>
Our conversation was every now and then
interrupted by the appearance of couriers with despatches.
The Pashà glanced at them rapidly, and signified his will
about them to an attendant secretary; but we were much
struck with the nice distinctions of rank observed, the
officers who bore the despatches advancing so many paces
from the door according to their official position, and the
officers in attendance on the Pashà being seated, with due
reference to their social espacement, at unequal distances
from the arm-chair which served as his Excellency’s
throne. The Pashà, in spite of his gracious smiles, looked
worn and preoccupied, so that we hastened to cut short
our interview, his Excellency rising and shaking hands
again in the most polite way at our departure.</p>

<p>Dervish Pashà is a little man of a shrewd countenance,
and though affable in his demeanour, not without a lurking
cunning in his small grey eyes beneath his affected
cheerfulness. It is indeed a melancholy stoicism that
supports Turks like himself of ability and education. The
fact is, that whatever his private opinion as to the issue of
the present contest in the Herzegovina, Dervish Pashà is
conscious that he is fighting for a lost cause. Like
many other of the highest Turkish officials, he feels,
and has confessed it to his friends, that whether the
crash come to-day or to-morrow, the Ottoman Empire
in Europe is irrevocably doomed. He is as well aware
as any European that among the governing race of
Turkey public honesty is as dead as private morality,
that corruption has closed the door to progress, and that
patriotism has almost ceased to exist; nor is he insensible
that the master whom he serves is the source
and seminary of these evils, and that nothing is to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
hoped from the secluded youth and corrupt morals of
him whom the Sultan would impose as his successor.
The Vali, in spite of the characteristic indifference of an
Osmanlì to the sufferings of rayahs, has not been without
ambition of improving the material condition of his Vilayet;
but he has seen himself thwarted from above by the corruption
of Stamboul, and below by the impenetrable
ignorance of his own officials. ‘What is the use?’ he
would complain to consular sympathizers when desirous
of introducing this or that reform. ‘What is the use of
giving such orders to the Mutasarìf or Kaïmakàm? they
cannot understand them, and if they did they could not
carry them out; the people would laugh at their reforms
or throw them off!’</p>

<p>Mostar, as a town, pleased us more than any we had
seen in Bosnia. The houses are almost all built of stone,
instead of the customary wood and plaster. Here, as at
Tešanj, we noticed a <i>Campanile</i>. There are many gay
kiosques rising over the graves of Moslem saints. The
mosques, of which there are forty, are many of them
domed, and the plate tracery of their windows is curiously
Roman or Byzantine: the minarets—which, not taking
their pinnacles into account, look like unfinished Corinthian
columns—struck us as more elegant than those of
Serajevo, and even the Byzantine church was in better
taste. The impression which the streets of Mostar are
perpetually forcing on us is that we have come once
more on the fringe of Roman civilization. These stone
houses are no longer the Turkish <i>Chalet</i>, but the <i>Casa</i> of
Italy or Dalmatia. Some are roofed with a rough slate,
others with tiles, Romanesque if not Roman. Every now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347"></a>[347]</span>
and then an Italian physiognomy strikes us among the
citizens; the auburn locks and blue eyes of the Illyrian
interior are giving place to swarthier hues. The name of
the mountain under whose barren steeps we passed on
our way here—Porim—in the Sclavonic tongue means on,
or over against Rome, and seems to indicate that this
part of the Narenta valley remained Roman at a time
when the mountain wilderness of the interior had passed
into the hands of the Sclavonic barbarians.<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> Mostar
indeed owes her name, and perhaps her very existence,
to Roman enterprise. The situation of the present city
has been identified with that of a Roman <i>Castra Stativa</i>
mentioned in the Itineraries,<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> and certainly there are
abundant traces here of Roman occupation. This morning
I looked through two hundred coins, nearly all of
them Roman, found in Mostar and its immediate vicinity,
and from the number of these of Consular date one may
gather that the Roman settlement dated back to the
earliest days of their Illyrian conquest.<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="illus47" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus47.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Mostar Bridge.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>But the most interesting monument of her early civilization,
and that to which Mostar, even at the present
day, owes much of her importance, is the magnificent
bridge over the Narenta. It is a single arch, 95 feet 3<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span>
inches in span,<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> and rising 70 feet above the river when
the water is low. According to tradition, this was the
work of the Emperor Trajan, whose engineering triumphs
in Eastern Europe have taken a strong hold on the South-Sclavonic
imagination. Others refer its erection to Hadrian,
and the Turks, not wishing to leave the credit of
such an architectural masterpiece to Infidel Emperors,
claim the whole for their Sultan, Suleiman the Magnificent.
He and other Turkish rulers have certainly greatly restored
and altered the work, insomuch that Sir Gardner
Wilkinson declares that none of the original Roman
masonry has been left on the exterior, but he was none
the less convinced of its Roman origin; and anyone who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span>
has seen it will agree with Sir Gardner that the grandeur
of the work, and the form of the arch, as well as
the tradition, attest its Roman origin. In the gateway-towers
at each end we also detected something Roman,
as besides in some ancient archways and masonry on the
river-bank by the side of the bridge. This sketch was
taken looking down the stream from the left side, and
indeed the view from this point needs not the spell of
classic associations to fascinate the beholder! The soaring
arch beneath which the emerald Narenta hurries—fuming
and fretting amongst the boulders that strew her
course in many a foamy eddy—as though after eighteen
centuries she were still impatient of the yoke<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> imposed
upon her by the monarch of the world; the steep banks
tiered with rocks, contorted, cavernous, festooned with
creepers and wild vines; above, the arcades of Turkish
stores, with brilliant Oriental wares; the peaks and towers
and gables of quaint old fortifications; two slender minarets,
and further still a fainter background of barren
mountain, against which the mediæval outlines of the
city were relieved in the chiaroscuro of a Southern sun.
The whole scene presented such a picturesque combination,
alike of colours and outlines, as I have not seen the like
of in any other town.</p>

<p>The very name of Mostar signifies in the Sclavonic
tongue ‘the old bridge,’<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a> and would be enough to prove
that the bridge was already looked on as an antiquity
before the Turkish conquest. Mostar was already a place
of importance under the dukes of St. Sava. The town<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span>
appears to have been much augmented in 1440 by Radivoj
Gost, <i>Curopalata</i> or ‘mayor of the palace’ to Stephen
Cossaccia, the first duke of St. Sava.<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> It was originally
peopled by Latin Christians, and was the residence of
their bishop, who afterwards emigrated to Narona. On
the Turkish conquest, Mostar became the seat of residence
of the Viziers of Herzegovina; and just as before the
dukes of St. Sava had exercised an authority almost independent
of their suzerains, the kings of Bosnia, so now
the Viziers of Herzegovina succeeded in defying their
Bosnian superiors, the lieutenants of the Grand Signior at
Travnik. One of the latest and most representative of
these Turkish dukes of St. Sava was the renowned Ali
Pashà, who, for the valuable assistance which he rendered
Sultan Mahmoud in his struggle with the Mahometan
magnates of Bosnia, was rewarded with the Vizierate of
Herzegovina, which in 1833 was separated from Bosnia
and erected into an independent government for the
benefit of this faithful servant of the Sultan.</p>

<p>Ali Pashà, originally Ali Aga of Stolac, the seat of
his hereditary castle and possessions, was a scion of the
renegade nobility of Herzegovina, and had been enabled
to aid the Grand Signior against his reactionary Mahometan
vassals, by resorting to the bold expedient of
arming his rayah retainers. He appears to have been
a man endued above the average with the Turkish aptitude
for dissimulation. While the Christians were useful
to him, he was profuse in his promises of reward, and
used to swear to them ‘by the golden cross’ that their
taxes would be abolished with the exception of a hundred
paras yearly of <i>haratch</i>. But, once in the Vizierial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
palace of Mostar, he increased the <i>haratch</i>, levied the
tithes with greater rigour, doubled the other taxes, and,
only anxious to conciliate the Moslems of his Pashalik,
allowed his agents to treat the rayahs with greater cruelty
than ever. On the pretence of seizing Christians who,
after fleeing to Montenegro, might presume, with brigandish
intent, to revisit the Herzegovina, he used to
send detachments of fanatical officers, who made the circuit
of the Christian villages, and ill-treated or murdered
whom they pleased, under the pretence that they
were <i>Uskoks</i>, as these refugees were called, or had sheltered
such. A native historian, a monk of Mostar,<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> has
related with a Herodotean simplicity the history of the
civil war in the Herzegovina and the reign of the terrible
Vizier; and the picture which he gives of the sufferings
of the rayahs, of the sort of justice which was meted out
to them in the country districts, and the sights with which
the tyrant in the palace of Mostar was wont to feast his
eyes, may serve to open people’s eyes to the character of
the government in this part of the Sultan’s dominions
during the years immediately preceding the Crimean War.
We must remember that the writer is a monk, but there
is a charming naïveté about the following narrations.</p>

<p>If the Pashà had a weakness, it was for impaled heads
of rayahs, so that when these <i>Uskok</i> hunters were disappointed
of legitimate game, they used to resort to a
rough and ready way of securing the Pashà’s approbation.
Thus in 1849 Ali Pashà sent Ibrahim, his Cavass-Basha,
to collect <i>Uskoks</i>. ‘Ibrahim,’ says our native historian,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span>
‘tarried in Drobniaki till October, but found no work
there wherewith to keep his hands warm. Therefore he
betook himself to the village Cerna Gora,<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a> and after he
had passed the night there, he gave orders to the villagers
that one out of every house should come forth
and accompany him to Piva. The poor villagers came
forth as he bade them; but when they had gone with
him one hour’s distance from their dwellings, their hands
were bound, and here, on the plain near Lysina, the
Cavass-Basha Ibrahim shot them dead one after the other.
And thus were slain fifteen men, Christians all, miserable
indeed in their life-time, but guiltless before the all-high
God. And wherefore were they slain? For naught, but
that there should be fewer Vlachs.’<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">[306]</a>...</p>

<p>‘The greatest delight of the Vizier was to look upon
Christian heads impaled. From his palace in Mostar he
could not see the fortress walls, and therefore had he them
made higher that he might see them when he lay at
meals; and round about the whole fortress he set up
palisades of pointed oak-staves, which he topped with
Christian heads. At these then looked he from his
window, and his heart leapt thereat for joy. If he would
oppress any man, he straightway spake and said, “Wilt
thou never cease to trouble me, till such time as I hew
thy head from thy body, and bid them stick it on the
palisades?—then shalt thou give me peace at last!”
Upon this fortress there were 150 staves, and upon each
stave was always fixed a dead man’s head.<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> But when his
murderous bands brought a fresh head, and there was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span>
room wanted for it, then Ali Pashà bade them take one
or more of the dried heads down, and throw them into
the street, where the children were wont to kick them
about for sport, and no man durst take them away.’</p>

<p>But Ali Pashà himself fell at last into disfavour with
the Porte, and his intrigues with the Mahometan magnates
of Bosnia in their final revolt against the Sultan in 1850
brought on his head the vengeance of the second conqueror
of Bosnia, Omer Pashà. The catastrophe of our
satrap, like the episodes of his tyranny, was thoroughly
Eastern, and as the closing scene of the drama is laid
with poetic fitness on the bridge of Mostar, I may be
allowed once more to have recourse to our Herzegovinian
historian.</p>

<p>‘The old, lame Ali Pashà was forced to limp on foot,
with a staff in his hand, to the bridge over the river
Narenta—and there they set him for mockery on a lean
and mangy mule, and in such a plight Omer Pashà led
with him our Ali Pashà, even he who for so many years
had ruled the Herzegovina according to his will, and had
done there so many evil deeds; but Ali Pashà was sore
vexed at his abasement, and straightway began to rail at
Omer Pashà, and amongst other things he said: “Why<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span>
dost thou torment me thus? Thou art a Vlach<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> and the
son of a Vlach! From whom hast thou authority to drag
me thus? Aye, and had I taken arms against the Sultan
himself, it is not to thee belongs the right to treat me as
one taken in battle, wert thou three times Seraskier.
Therefore, O unclean Vlach! send me rather to my Padishah,
that he may judge me, and vex me not in my old
age.” But when Omer Pashà heard this, he feared lest
peradventure he himself should suffer damage at Stamboul;
for Ali Pashà had many friends there amongst
those in high places, to whom he was wont to send much
money from the Herzegovina. So Omer Pashà, turning
these things over in his mind, in the end perceived that
it were better if Ali Pashà were no longer of this world.
And lo! at night, at two of the clock, was heard the
sound as of a shot, and there came tidings to Omer Pashà
that it had so chanced a gun had gone off, and behold the
ball had passed through Ali Pashà’s head. Thus died
Ali Pashà, Rizvanbegović, on the twentieth day of March,
1851.’</p>

<p>Mostar contains about 18,000 inhabitants,<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> and is
therefore a considerable town for this part of the world.
For trade, it has long been the chief staple of Herzegovina,
and was renowned of old for its manufacture of Damascened
swords. The wares, however, here are much the
same as those of Serajevo, so that I have little to record
of the streets of Mostar, except that one old Turk—whose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[355]</span>
principles I respect—swore by the beard of the
Prophet that he would never sell the meanest knife on
his shop-board to a dog of a Giaour; and that one Mostar
damsel—about whose principles I will not enquire, but of
whose amiability there can be no question—deftly dropped
her veil as we passed her doorway, and favoured us with
a private view of a not uncomely face.<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> Indeed we
noticed that in the lower valley of the Narenta generally
the use of the veil is not so rigorously enforced as usually
in Bosnia, though the face-covering is absolutely discarded
only at Jablanica and the adjoining district.</p>

<p>There was one very pleasant feature about the streets
of Mostar, and that was the abundance of fruit. The
peaches were poor; but melons, figs, and the grapes at
about a halfpenny a pound, even when a Frank was a
purchaser, were delicious. The grapes, of which the
Mostar wine famed throughout all these lands is made,
are of magnificent calibre, and are celebrated in Serbian
song. When the bride of Mahmoud Pashà<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> speeds with
the choicest delicacies of earth to comfort princely Mujo,
these are not forgotten in the dainty <i>menu</i>. The lady
hides beneath her richest garments:—</p>

<p class="noindent">We too, as a preparation for our weary pilgrimage across<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span>
the Karst deserts of the lower Narenta to the Dalmatian
frontier, took with us a generous basket of the fruits of
Mostar.</p>

<p>The day was terribly hot, and a suffocating miasmatic
vapour<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> (such as we had not met with since we left the
valley of the Save) brooded over the city, which, according
to our Consul, possesses a climate decidedly hotter
than that of Constantinople, so that we were naturally
desirous of lightening our day’s journey to the frontier
by obtaining horses. These, however, it was extremely
hard to obtain; but the Pashà, to whom we mentioned
our difficulty, generously placed a couple of horses at our
disposal, and told us that if we would start this afternoon
we should have the advantage of a guard that was to
accompany a caravan of Herzegovinians to Metcović, our
Dalmatian destination. We being anxious to push on,
as we were really afraid of this climate, took advantage
of the proposal, and about five in the afternoon started
with our cavalcade on the most terrible journey I ever
remember.</p>

<p>Our caravan, consisting of sixty horses and men,
slowly mustered together, and having defiled out of
Mostar over the steep Narenta bridge, we jogged for
hours along tedious dusty plains, leaving on our left the
ruins of the feudal stronghold of Blagaj, once the treasury,
as its name implies, and castle of the Duke of St. Sava.
About sunset we heard many muttered prayers, and an
‘Ave Maria’ continually repeated by a rayah who was
riding near; then it grew dark, so that my brother and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[357]</span>
myself, who both of us suffer from night-blindness, could
not see an inch; but still the whole caravan jogged on, and
though the stars, shining with a reddish, lurid light, looked
more like ‘lamps of heaven’ than the pale stars of old acquaintance,
they did not aid our purblind vision in the least,
and we felt particularly helpless when we perceived by the
noise of water running a good way immediately below us
that we were riding along the brink of a precipitous steep.
However, our beasts followed their leaders, till suddenly
there was an universal stampede—my horse rushed down
a steep bank, nearly throwing me off, and then plunged
into a stream to drink, and after some more stumbling
and climbing we found ourselves in a struggling crowd
of men and horses, and were told to dismount. Then
our steeds disappeared, and we found ourselves together
wedged into a trampling throng in what to us was pitch
darkness. Happily, a Zaptieh, who had been ordered by
the Pashà to attend on us, rescued us from this plight,
and we discovered that we had arrived at a Han called
Buna, where we obtained coffee and a room to ourselves
over a stable, and rested three hours.</p>

<p>This Han was erected here by our old friend Ali
Pashà, who was something more than an impaler of
rayahs, and did many things to improve the means of
communication and the material well-being of his Pashalik.
To him Herzegovina owes the introduction of
rice culture, and also of silk-worms; and it was here, at
Buna, that he planted, with this object, the first mulberry-trees
in the country. The Vizier built a favourite summer
residence here, of which and its grounds the Mostar
historian gives a curious description. The little river
Buna, which, issuing from a cavern in the rock below<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span>
the castle of Blagai, here pours into the Narenta, is, like
it, according to our monk, ‘rich in innumerable fish,’
while the Pashà’s grounds abounded in ‘all the fruits of
the South.’ ‘Ali Pashà laid down pipes in which he
conducted water from the Buna, and he brought hither
a dragon’s head of lead which poured forth the water
from its throat into a stone basin, wherein rare fishes
played. Here the Satrap was wont to tarry for his
pleasure; and when his bloodthirsty servants brought
him the heads of Christian Serbs, he bade them to be
stuck on the poles of a palisade that stood opposite, and
in gazing on them had his chiefest delight.’</p>

<p><i>Aug. 30th.</i>—During our midnight halt at Buna we
were not in a position to examine the Vizier’s villa,
nor had we long given us even for repose, for at 2.30 we
were roused once more by our Zaptieh, and having been
guided to our horses in the dark, were again jogging on
our way, and ascending a range of high limestone hills by
a rough winding road, without the slightest aid from
vision. As morning gradually revealed to us our surroundings,
we found that we were crossing a rock-strewn
table-land almost bereft of trees, except a few olives, and
some fine old oaks shading an ancient solitary graveyard
The motion was most fatiguing, as our horses were anything
but sure-footed; and the saddle was simply excruciating.
The saddle of these countries is simply formed of two
hurdle-like frames of wood joined together in the middle
at an angle of over fifty degrees, and padded <i>underneath</i>,
to protect the horse. We had to sit astride on the sharp
upper keel, and had nothing but our sleeping-gear to
mitigate its hardness. Add to this the perpetual jolting
and stumbling, and the fact that the stirrups were simply<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span>
loops of cord, which twisted our toes under our horses’
bellies, and our discomfort may be imagined. The dust
kicked up by our caravan was terrible, so that to avoid
it we wished to ride in front; but our horses, who knew
their place in the ranks, could not be induced to stir
from it till we dismounted and literally dragged them in
front. The pace was provokingly slow, and the Herzegovinian
drivers were perpetually reminding their beasts
of the duty of sloth by shouts of <i>Polacko! polacko!</i><a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>
My beast didn’t need any reminder of this kind, and
nothing on earth would induce him to put on a spurt so
as to distance our dusty train, till by some happy inspiration
I whistled to him ‘Little Polly Perkins of Paddington
Green.’ Then, at last, the intelligent animal pricked up
its ears and broke into a lively trot!</p>

<p>For many hours we had been riding through a
wilderness, but as we approached the southern edge of
our plateau a prospect of desolation broke upon us such
as those who have not seen it can scarcely imagine. In
every direction rose low mountains, mere heaps of disintegrated
limestone rock, bare of vegetation as a shingly
sea-beach—a cruel southern Karst, aptly compared to a
petrified glacier or a moon-landscape, the creation—as
the old Bogomiles of these parts would have supposed it—of
some Evil Spirit. Yet, like most things in nature, this
desert prospect is not without its redeeming specialities
of beauty. Where the colours of earth are so faint there
is nothing to interfere with the most perfect development
of atmospheric effects. Nature has, as it were, provided
a white sheet for the grandest of all illuminators, and I
have seen these pale rock skeletons tinged by morning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span>
and evening suns with more delicate saffron and peach-blossom
than the green hills of more fertile lands are
susceptible of taking. Even as seen by the light of common
day, this barren panorama was well worth an artist’s
study. We were among mountain-tops without the
climbing; and though the languor of the colours spoke
too evidently of the universal waterlessness, their delicacy
was novel and not without a subtle fascination. The sky
above was of a pale hazy azure; the sterile hill-sides a
thin ashy grey, stained here and there with a <i>soupçon</i> of
sand colour or faint iron brown; the plain below was the
palest and most languid of greens.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/illus48.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Christian Monuments, Tassorić.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>About 9 in the morning we stopped at a hamlet
called Tassorić, where the caravan made their next halt;
but though we tried here and at other hovels on the
road to obtain some food, we met with one universal
response: ‘Nima chlébba! nima jaje!’—‘We have no
bread! we have no eggs!’ And the only refreshment
we could obtain in this terrible waste was the never-failing
coffee; so that had it not been for the figs and grapes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[361]</span>
we had brought with us from Mostar, we might have
fainted by the way. The Herzegovinian peasants who
travelled with us had brought their food with them.</p>

<p>The seat on which we quaffed our mocha here was
supported by two fragmentary bases of Roman columns;
but in a graveyard hard by, which we had leisure to examine,
were modern monuments of still greater interest.
These were the gravestones of the Roman Catholic inhabitants
of Tassorić, which were ornamented with incised
crosses and floral devices of an elegance indeed
surprising when it is remembered that these were the
work of rude peasants, unable to write even the names of
the departed kinsmen whom they wished to honour.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp78" id="illus49" style="max-width: 31.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus49.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Graveyard at Tassorić.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The whole appearance of this graveyard was indeed
one of the most curious sights that we observed in our
Bosnian-Herzegovinian experiences. Here, in one God’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span>
acre, alike the Infidel and Christian inhabitants of the
hamlet had found their last resting-place, and the crosses
of the departed rayahs were only separated by a narrow,
and in places almost indistinguishable pathway from
the turbaned columns of the Moslem. It was a striking
proof that even in this land of bigotry and persecution
both sectaries can live together in peace; and it afforded
a melancholy contrast to the burnt villages whose ruins
we descried a few miles further on the road.</p>

<p>The fact is, that the animosity of the rayahs of the
Herzegovina has not been directed so much against their
Moslem fellow-villagers as against the Begs, the scions of
the renegade feudal nobility, who, besides exacting their
own dues with the rigour that I have described, often—in
the Herzegovina especially, where at present they seem
to have retained more of their old power than in Bosnia—farm
the government taxes. The tithe-farmers here
are still called by the old ominous name of <i>Spahi</i>. These
oppress the Moslem peasant almost as grievously as the
rayah, and there have been instances during the present
outbreak in which the Moslems of the country villages
have made common cause with the rayah. It was primarily
against the Begs that the Roman Catholic population
of this part of the Narenta valley<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> took up arms last
June.</p>

<p>A little further on we passed the Roman Catholic
village of Draševo, whose inhabitants, with those of
another village called Rasno, were the first to take up
arms in this part of the Herzegovina. These assembled
with arms in their hands at a bridge just beyond, where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[363]</span>
the high road crosses the little river Kruppa, and which,
though the only means of transit for any stores and
cannon that the Turks may land at their port of Klek on
the other side of the hills, we found in a condition so
dilapidated that we had to dismount from our horses and
lead them carefully over the broken woodwork—the
whole fabric being so cranky that it would only bear one
man and beast at a time. At this bridge the assembled
rayahs kept watch and ward, allowing travellers, and
even Zaptiehs, to pass (for it was no part of the design
of the insurgents at first to war against the Sultan), but
declaring that they were keeping watch against the Begs
alone.</p>

<p>But it was at a mill called Struge, which we left to the
right on the further bank of the Narenta, that the first
actual outbreak of hostilities took place. The miller
here was a Mussulman, who, offended at the spirited attitude
taken up by the neighbouring rayah villages, refused
to grind the corn which the Christians, who depended on
his grindstone for this part of their breadmaking, brought
him for that purpose. Thereupon the Christians of the
neighbouring village of Gorica resolved to take vengeance
on the unbelieving miller. The miller, on his part, was
aided by a division of Zaptiehs; and here the first shots
were fired. The Turks were victorious, and the Zaptiehs
signalized their victory by entering Gorica the following
night, and burning, after first sacking, the houses of the
rayahs, who had themselves escaped. They then defiled
the church, and as a further insult dug up some dead
bodies and left the naked corpses of a man and a child
exposed in the churchyard. The insurgents of the
Narenta valley and the country to the right of it were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span>
thus unfortunate from the beginning, so that when the
Turks, by the murder of the prior of the Franciscan
monastery at Livno, had terrified the Roman Catholic
hierarchy of this part into submission, the Catholic Bishop
Kraljević found no difficulty in persuading the Latin peasantry
to follow the example of their spiritual governors.</p>

<p>A little way beyond the bridge where the rayahs first
set their armed watch against the Begs, we came to the
ruins of the village of Doliane, burnt, as we heard, by
the Turks at a very early period of the insurrection.
It was a miserable sight, the blackened shells of these
little stone hovels—piteous at any time—clinging to the
bare hill-side. The Turks were utilizing the ruins to build
a guard-house, and were pulling down for that purpose the
few homestead walls which had still been left standing.
Yet this is but a single sample of the devastation which
extends along the whole Dalmatian and Montenegrine
borders of Herzegovina, over an area embracing many
hundreds of square miles.</p>

<p>A mile more of jolting brought us to the Dalmatian
frontier, and at Metcović we found ourselves once more
within the limits of Christendom with whole skins, but
quite worn out after (deducting rests) fifteen hours of
excruciation on Bosnian saddles. Of this future emporium
of Narentan trade there is little to record, except
the filth of the inhabitants. The cleanliness of the Turks
and Herzegovinians contrasts most strongly with the
South-Italian squalor of the citizens of Metcović, which
culminated in the family circle of the <i>Bezirkshauptmann</i>—an
interview with whom was forced on us for the examination
of passports. The <i>Bezirkshauptmann’s</i> table-cloth
was so filthy that there was not a spot of anything approaching
whiteness on its whole superficies!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_365"></a>[365]</span></p>

<p><i>Aug. 31st.</i>—Next morning, after considerable bargaining,
we engaged a flat beetle-like craft to convey
ourselves and our fortunes to Stagno, <i>viâ</i> the left arm of
the Narenta. The landscape now afforded most startling
contrasts of fertility and barrenness. The heights that
overhung the Narenta, or stretched away to environ its
broad alluvial plains, were mere rock heaps, of that lunar
desolation already described; so bare that the mountain
goat can scarce glean a pittance on their bony terraces.
But the broad delta below, formed by the double-armed
Narenta, is the richest land in all Dalmatia; the maize
by the river-side attains a gigantic stature; on other
places the soil is covered by a luxuriant network of vines,
which, without any training or apparent cultivation, yield
grapes as fine as those of Mostar; and there are mulberry-trees
at Fort Opus fifteen feet in circumference. But
how little of this marvellous rich soil is even culturable
now-a-days! To the right of us, what was once a blooming
champaign, covered with tilled fields, and dowering a
city wealthy and refined, is now a stretch of fever-breeding
marshes which it would cost millions to drain. The
wretched inhabitants of the few villages that now remain,
are, during the summer months, never free from intermittent
fever, and the stranger who values his life must not
tarry at this season even to explore the interesting relics
of antiquity that we are now passing on our right.</p>

<p>Among the swamps that lie two or three miles to
the north of Metcović are still to be seen the foundations
of many of the houses of the Illyrian Narbonne,<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">[315]</a><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[366]</span>
further remains of which, including many inscriptions,
are scattered on the hill above, which takes its name
from the modern village of Viddo. Here stood the old
Narbona, or as it was called in the later days of Rome,
Narona; a city so ancient that it was already of renown
five centuries before our era, and which lost none of its
eminence when, in <span class="allsmcap">B.C.</span> 168, Lucius Annius added it to
the possessions of Rome. At Narbona, now known as
Narona, the Romans planted a colony, and among the
many inscriptions that have been discovered, we find
ample witness to its municipal liberties; while from
others we learn that temples of Jove, Diana of the woods,
and Father Liber, once graced this spot. Another inscription
on the tomb of a Naronan <i>lapidary</i>, to which
I shall have occasion to refer, may, perhaps, bear witness
to an art which attained considerable perfection in the
cities of Roman Illyria, and of which many traces, in the
shape of beautifully engraved gems, are still discovered
on this site.</p>

<p>Yet it was not under the Romans that Narona and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span>
the rich alluvial plains of the Narenta, amidst which our
boat is meandering, attained that importance which
makes the name of the Narentines familiar to the student
of European history.</p>

<p>In the year 639 <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> Narona, which till then had
remained a flourishing Roman city, was reduced to ashes
by a mingled horde of Avars and Sclaves, and a few
years later the Serbian Sclaves called in by the Emperor
Heraclius took possession of the vacant sites of the lower
Narenta. Out of the ruins of the Roman Narona they
built a new town, and here, on the site of classic temples,
reared a fane to a Sclavonic god, whose name, Viddo,<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">[316]</a>
is still perpetuated in that of the modern village. The
site of this Illyrian Narbonne thus became a stronghold of
heathendom in these parts, just as with the Sclavonians
of the Baltic shores Paganism found its last defenders
among those staunch Rügen islanders who guarded the
precincts of the sacred city of Arkona. It was not till
the year 873 that Nicetas, the Admiral of the Byzantine
Emperor Basil, prevailed on the Narentines to accept
baptism; the temple of their country’s god underwent
a strange conversion, and Viddo lived again in a
Christian guise as St. <i>Vitus</i>!<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<p>In the next century the country of the Narentines is
still known as <i>Pagania</i>, the land of the Pagans, by which
name Constantine Porphyrogenitus mentions it in his
account of the Serbians; and it was during the ninth and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368"></a>[368]</span>
tenth centuries that these barbarous Sclaves, yet untamed
by a civilized religion, issued forth from the swamps
and inlets of the Narenta, to ravage the coasts of the
Adriatic, and to rival their heathen counterparts and
contemporaries, the Sea-kings of the North. As early as
827 their ‘Archons,’ as the Byzantine Emperor calls the
Starosts of their Republic, refused to pay the customary
tribute to Eastern Rome; and soon after this date we find
them in possession of Curzola, Lagosta, Meleda, Lesina,
Brazza, and other islands of the Adriatic. But it is their
rivalry with Venice which exalts the history of the
Narentines into world importance. The rising city of
the lagoons saw her commerce cut off by these hardy
corsairs, and was at last actually forced to pay them an
ignominious tribute. It was not till 997 that the Doge
Pietro Orseolo II. succeeded in throwing off the yoke
and attacking the pirates in their Narentan fastnesses.
After three centuries of piratic domination, the Narentines
saw all their island empire taken from them, and themselves
not only forced to disgorge their plunder, but to
swear allegiance to their rival. The power of the Pirate
State was broken for ever; but the fate of Venice had
trembled in the balance, and for a moment the whole
current of European civilization seemed destined to be
perverted from its channel by the inhabitants of the now
obscure valley through which we are passing. It were
perhaps as idle to speculate what might have been the
history of Europe, had the Queen of the Adriatic been
smothered in her cradle, as to discuss the fates of Lerna
or Nemea, had infant Heracles perished in the coils of the
serpent which he strangled; but the most casual student
of Venetian annals must perceive that the final triumph<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369"></a>[369]</span>
of Venice over the Narentines is the great climacteric in
the history of her rise.</p>

<p>We thought we detected something of the old piratic
genius of the race in the way in which our boatmen
plundered the maize and vine fields as we passed; but
there was nothing of Pagan savagery in their demeanour
and conversation, which on the contrary formed a marked
contrast to the rudeness and asperity of the ordinary
Bosniac or Herzegovinian. They spoke indeed a dialect
closely akin to the Illyrian of the interior, but they spoke
it with energy, vivacity, elegance; with a softness of cadence
so thoroughly Italian, that when, as all of them did
at times, they changed to that language to address the
signori, we hardly detected the change. Their very form
is lither, suppler; of lesser mould, but a striking contrast
to the overgrown ungraceful Bosniac. The eyebrows of
these Narentines are not so arched, the hair is darker;
they seemed to be many of them Sclavonized Italians,
descendants perhaps of the Roman colonists of Narbona.
One of our boatmen was a very interesting type of man.
He spoke Dalmatian like the rest, but his face—which,
like that of many other Dalmatian faces that I recall,
beamed with all the openness of a sea-faring people—was
typically Scotch; and, oddly enough, he wore what looked
like a Scotch cap, minus the tails. His hair was of a
lighter and more reddish hue than that of the others.
One almost fancied that we had here before us a waif of
that early Celtic population of Illyria already invoked
as nomenclators of the Illyrian Narbonne whose ruins we
are passing to our right.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we have been making very slow progress,
since a fierce scirocco has set dead in the teeth of our<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_370"></a>[370]</span>
small craft; and as we arrive at Fort Opus, an old Venetian
station at the apex of the Narentan delta, our boatmen
inform us that our two-master is too lubberly for them
to hope to take us to Stagno in it while the scirocco
continues to blow, in which case the voyage might take
two or three days. They professed their willingness to
find a smaller vessel which should be able to cope with
the elements, and to resign half the wages, for which we
had agreed upon, to the new boatmen. ‘You see, Sirs,
it is not for want of will—but we cannot struggle against
God!’</p>

<p>At Fort Opus, accordingly, we shifted into another
smaller craft, pointed at both stern and stem, and beetle-like
as the other, and were soon on our way again along
a part of the Narenta’s course which might well be the
source of weirdest myth and legend. Just beyond Fort
Opus, the hills on the left—bonier skeletons, if possible,
than before—draw nearer to the river, till they frown
over its depths. It is at this point that ever and anon
mysterious boomings and bellowings are heard to proceed
as from the inmost recesses of the mountain. It is, say
those who have heard it, as the bellowing of a bull,
sometimes here, sometimes there, and sometimes everywhere
at once. At other times it seems to issue from the
darkest pools of the Narenta itself. I cannot say that we
ourselves heard the ‘hideous hum,’ but these noises cannot
be set down as the creatures of superstitious imagination;
for a competent observer, Signor Lanza, who was physician
in this district, and to whom is due a scientific
account of this part of the Narenta valley, has himself
borne ample witness of the existence of this phenomenon;
nor does it stand alone, for there are equally authentic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_371"></a>[371]</span>
accounts of similar subterranean murmurs and explosions
having been heard in Meleda and other islands of the
Dalmatian Littorale. The explanation given by some is
that the detonations are due to the pressure of the tide on
the air pent up in the subterranean caverns which honeycomb
the limestone Karst-formation of these Illyrian
coastlands; but Dr. Lanza—who notices that the phenomenon
generally takes place either at sunrise or sundown—confesses
that ‘a veil of mystery hangs over the
whole.’ Meanwhile, nothing but the portent is certain;
and fearful as I am of giving publicity to ill-omened
words, I cannot refrain from breathing a suspicion that
this unhallowed bellowing may proceed from some hideous
Minotaur, caverned in his labyrinthine den.</p>

<p>This neighbourhood is also much subject to earthquakes,
which generally occur during the winter months;
and as our boat toiled heavily past a succession of rocky
headlands, we ourselves experienced a natural phenomenon
scarcely less awful than these subterranean bellowings
and convulsions. The wind rose higher and higher,
whistling among the limestone ‘ruins of the older world’
that frowned above us. Our two boatmen knit their brows
and muttered ‘<i>la Fortuna!</i>’ Dame Fortune, the old
goddess of the way by sea and land, still retains some of
her old attributes of wheel and rudder among these Romanized
Dalmatian Sclaves; her name<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> is still used on
these coastlands as equivalent to a tempest; and even in
the interior of Bosnia the Sclaves have so far adopted the
idea, that a snow-storm—the kind of storm dreaded most
in the Bosnian mountains—is known to the peasants as
‘<i>Fortunja</i>.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_372"></a>[372]</span></p>

<p>At last, on steering between the two rocky hills,
whose barren masses rise on either side at the mouth of
this arm of the Narenta like twin pillars of Hercules, a
tremendous scene burst upon us. Just opposite to where
the river widened into the sea, towered before us—its limestone
crags and boulders up-piled and jumbled in cataclysmic
confusion—a small desolate island, a fit abode for
nothing unless it were departed spirits of the evil. The
rays of a pale ominous sunset fell upon these cadaverous
rocks and flooded them with spectral light. On either
side of the island the sea shone with abnormal emerald
lustre; but what made the brilliance of the foreground
so unearthly, was the unutterable darkness of all behind.
The rocky island rose like a phantom against a sky as
black as night.</p>

<p>The question for us was whether there would be time
to round the nose of rock to the left of the Narenta
mouth, and cross a narrow arm of green sea to a promontory
where we might obtain shelter, before the impending
hurricane came down on us.</p>

<p>The sailors thought it possible, and with set teeth
laboured at the oars as for grim life. But the black pall
of clouds that darkened the western hemisphere drew
nearer and nearer; the white sea-mews swept wildly and
more wildly hither and thither against the face of coming
night, shrieking weirdly like the Banshees of coming doom.
The wind and thunder roared louder in our ears, and a
thin snowy line of surf stretching along the emerald horizon,
swept like a charge of cavalry across the intervening
fields of sea—but now, so treacherously smooth!—and
dashed down upon our little craft.</p>

<p>The night was already upon us; the brilliant beams<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373"></a>[373]</span>
of sunset were suddenly transformed, first into darkness,
and then into the lurid twilight of an eclipse which lit up
our men’s faces with a pale ashy grey, ghastly to look
upon. These hardy descendants of corsairs seemed really
cowed, and shouted to us ‘Pray to God, signori! Pray to
God! <i>La Fortuna è rotta!</i>’</p>

<p>The storm had burst with a vengeance. The wind rose
to a hurricane. The surf and tempest struck our boat
and beat her head round. It was in vain that the men
struggled at the oars; we were borne back, and swept
along helpless as a log in a torrent. We were driven
towards the mouth of the Narenta which we had left,
and I thought every moment we should have been dashed
against the rocks; but Dame Fortune was merciful to us,
and notwithstanding that the men lost all command of the
vessel, we rounded the rocky headland, and found ourselves
in comparatively sheltered waters where oars were
again available, so that we were presently anchored near
another small Narentan vessel in smoother waters—though
even the river was one sheet of foam. It now
began to rain in torrents beyond all our experience;
so we covered ourselves with our macintoshes, and lay
down in the bottom of our boat, resolved not to emerge
till the hurricane should have abated somewhat of its
fury. But hardly were we settled, when a tremendous
clap of thunder rent the air, followed by a series of sharp
blows which made us start to our feet, when we found
that hailstones varying in size from a bullet to a walnut,
and in shape like Tangerine oranges,<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> were rattling about
our heads. With our helmet hats on, and under cover of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>[374]</span>
our macintoshes, we avoided being actually bruised, but
the thunder and lightning that accompanied the hail
were still more terrific. The forked lightning literally
played around our craft, and it seemed that it must
be struck; the thunder was such as we had neither of
us heard the like of before. For a quarter of an hour
we endured the full brunt of this celestial cannonade,
and then the storm passed away as suddenly as it had
come, and rolled on among the more inland ranges of the
Dinaric Alps, which the lightning kept throwing into
vivid and unexpected reliefs behind us; while in front
and overhead, sky and rocks and sea were illumined
with the renewed splendour of sunset, and the surface
of the troubled Narenta calmed down into its wonted
serenity.</p>

<p>But it was a storm such as one does not meet with
twice in a life-time; it was a fit initiation into this iron-bound
coastland, with its earthquakes and subterranean
thunders—the cavernous home of winds and tempests—the
last refuge of piratic races.</p>

<p>We now renewed our voyage, and crossing a narrow
arm of sea, landed in a sheltered cove, where we took
refuge in a spacious stone house, the abode of a Dalmatian
Family-community, hoping for the scirocco to subside, in
order to be able to pursue our course up the Stagno.
We were shown into the common eating and cooking
room, a spacious chamber on the ground-floor, where the
family gathered round us; and the men, when they heard
that we were English, at once claimed us as brothers, and
entered into a most friendly conversation. ‘We like the
English,’ said one; ‘we know your greatness on the
sea, and we too are a nation of seamen; England and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375"></a>[375]</span>
Dalmatia!—there are no sailors but in your country
and ours!’ Another of the men had been to London
and Plymouth, and he and the others aired a string of
English phrases with a decidedly nautical flavour, amongst
which we detected ‘Or’ right,’ ‘cup o’ tea,’ ‘grog,’ ‘haul
up,’ ‘ease her;’ and other expressions proving their
<i>entente cordiale</i> with ‘Jack.’ About nine in the evening
the woman-kind, the children, and some of the men, betook
themselves to sleeping chambers above, and we were
shown a bed in the spacious hall below, on whose floor
slept our seamen and some of the inmates. But the stuffiness
was so suffocating within, that I preferred the gnats
and night air without; and finding a convenient rock
on which to pillow my head, imitated the example of
Jacob.</p>

<p>About midnight the adverse wind fell, and I being,
by now, sufficiently disillusioned of patriarchal repose,
hastened to rouse L⸺ and our men, and we were again
on our way before 1 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span>, the wind shifting enough to
enable us every now and then to use our sail. We
steered along the Canale di Stagno piccolo, passing in the
dark the inlet in which the Turkish harbour of Klek is
situate. About 8 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> we landed at Luka, on the peninsula
of Sabbioncello, and making our way on foot across the
isthmus, entered the old town of Stagno by a gateway
through its high machicolated Venetian walls. It was a
small friendly place with clean narrow streets, and many
old stone palaces of the citizen nobility with stone escutcheons
over their doors, quaint rope mouldings and
carved corbels under the windows, some of which were
of Venetian-Gothic style. Other houses, whose owners
probably could lay no claim to coats of arms, displayed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376"></a>[376]</span>
over their doorways medallions on which I.H.S. was engraved
in a variety of ornamental forms. In the Piazza
just inside the gate by which we entered lay an old font
with many noble shields upon it, and in the city wall
opposite was a Renaissance fountain with a sixteenth-century
date upon it. Stagno was once a port of the
Bosnian kings, till sold by one of them to Ragusa at the
end of the fourteenth century.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp71" id="illus50" style="max-width: 29.6875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus50.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Women and Child, Stagno.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The peasants in the Piazza were highly picturesque;
the men, like the inhabitants of the lower Narenta,
strongly resembling the Turks in their attire, except for
a yellow sash round their waist, a Dalmatian peaked fez
on their head, and an ear-ring—a plain golden circle—in
one ear. The women, with their kerchiefs crossed about
their bosom, showed more Sclavonic characteristics in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377"></a>[377]</span>
their dress, but their straw hats with long streamers gave
them a certain Swiss air.</p>

<p>While sketching the little group above, in the Piazza,
I was somewhat surprised to hear the inspiriting tune of
‘Men of Harlech’ proceeding from a neighbouring house;
but the mystery was cleared up by our shortly receiving
a message to the effect that ‘the daughter of the
Judge of Stagno’ wished to secure an interview with the
Englishmen; and then it was that we found that this
amiable young lady, having lived some years in Wales,
and looking back with a tender regret to her sojourn in
our island, had resorted to the innocent device of playing
the national melodies of the Principality in order to
attract our attention.... But alas! the boat is starting
for Ragusa—the parting has taken place,—we have left
our romantic damsel to sigh once more for English society,
and stagnate at Stagno.</p>

<p>Our boat—a <i>Trabaccolo</i>, I believe it is called—is
equipped with an expansive lateen sail, and as a propitious
breeze, the Maestro, has sprung up, we soon leave Stagno,
its olives and oleanders and pretty flowering shrubs, its
siren music and bright eyes, far in our wake, and scud
along between rocky islands to our right, and the bare
Karst mountains of the mainland to our left. The desolate,
monotonous hills, perpetually repeating themselves,
were hardly relieved by a stunted tree—it was the same
scenery so well described by Ovid in his Pontic exile:</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>At one point, indeed, the village of Canosa, there was
an oasis of green in the desert landscape; this was the
gigantic group of plane trees, which are said to rank<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_378"></a>[378]</span>
among the finest in the world. But we are nearing
Ragusa, and after passing a line of jagged <i>scoglie</i> which
start up from the deep like the teeth of a gigantic antediluvian,
the sea, hitherto hardly recovered from its
frenzy of yestereen, becomes tranquil once more, and we
glide into the harbour of Gravosa, the port of modern
Ragusa, for depth and capacity reckoned the finest in
Dalmatia.</p>

<p>As we entered the harbour of Gravosa we passed on
our left an enticing watery gorge, which I am doubtful
whether to call sea or river. This is known as the Valle
d’Ombla; and as it presents one of the most extraordinary
natural phenomena in the whole of Dalmatia, and is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380"></a>[380]</span>
withal a most favourite pleasaunce of Ragusan citizens,
I did not omit to pay my devoirs to it during my stay in
the city of the Argosies.</p>

<p>For two miles and a half after leaving the harbour of
Gravosa our boat (for it is best approached by water)
sailed up a broad and winding channel of the most exquisite
crystalline blue, reflecting on either side rocky
heights, and lower slopes covered with cypresses and
olives, and here and there dotted with white villas and
cottages. About two miles and a half from the point
where this inlet debouches into the harbour of Gravosa,
the channel suddenly narrowed, and the boat had to be
propelled up the river proper, which is rapid and of
considerable volume. Its whole course was not more
than a mile.</p>

<p>A little way beyond a church called Rosgiatto, rose
before us a precipitous limestone mountain, whose ridge
forms the boundary of the Herzegovina, and beyond
which we heard distinctly the noise of an engagement
then going on between the insurgents and the Turks.
At the foot of this mountain the river Ombla springs from
the bowels of the earth, with sufficient energy to work a
mill at its very source, and in such volume that we
may safely echo the words of the Ragusan poet, Elio
Cervino:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Danubio et Nilo non vilior Ombla fuisset</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">Si modo progressus posset habere suos.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>At the mill, which has several large water-wheels, we
landed, and from beneath the shadow of a fig-tree, then
laden with golden fruit, surveyed this stupendous spring.</p>

<p>The source itself is nearly forty yards in breadth,
squaring off against a wall of naked limestone rock which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381"></a>[381]</span>
rises above it nearly perpendicularly, some fifteen hundred
feet. So untroubled is the pool, so still is all around,
that you can hardly realise that a river is welling up from
far below. Here and there, however, the glassy surface
seems to swell and heave, and in places the waters take
a mysterious intensity of sapphire that speaks of unfathomable
depths. For centuries indeed the sources
remained unfathomed, and it needed a line eighteen
hundred feet long before the bottom was reached at
last!<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> The mystery of the Ombla’s origin has been solved
by observing the sympathy in ebb and flow which it
shows with an inland river, the Trebinjštica, on which
lies the old Herzegovinian city of Trebinje. This river is
absorbed by Mother Earth in two several places, and one
of its swallow-holes is distant about seven miles, as the
crow flies, from the source of the Ombla. Thus the river
must pass right under a mountain chain, and accomplish
many miles of underground meanderings before it again
emerges.</p>

<p>The Ombla appears to have been known to the
ancients as the Arion, and Virgil might well have given
it a preference of immortality over the Timavus, whose
springs are too scattered and of too small a volume to
impress the spectator. Doubtless Arion had his nymphs,
and certainly in mediæval times they seem to have found
their successor, even as the mossy cell of nymph Egeria
became the heritage of Santa Rosalia. Just above the
source, amidst a shady grove of fig-trees, I came upon the
ruins of a chapel with some fair fifteenth-century mouldings,
and, carved over a doorway, an angel and St. Mary
with the inscription <span class="allsmcap">AVE GRACIA PLENA</span>, which would<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382"></a>[382]</span>
indicate the Christian Nymph of the Source to have been
no other than Our Lady.</p>

<p>But let us leave this pleasant resort, and resume our
way to Ragusa herself.</p>

<p>As we mounted upwards over the neck of land which
separates the modern port of Ragusa from the ancient
city, a magnificent view of the land-locked harbour of
Ragusa, and the shipping anchored on its tranquil waters,
opened out behind us. The stern rocky heights which
keep watch and ward over this fiord of Southern sea, and
shield it from the fierce blasts of Bora and Scirocco,
soften down perforce as they approach that wondrous
ultramarine margin. This old historic shore—it too has
‘espoused the everlasting sea,’ and clothes itself in
raiment worthy of the consort that slumbers in its ample
bosom! Luxuriant vines, pale olive woods, and thickets
of stately cypresses overspread the lower slopes; and this
Southern vegetation, with its alternating gloom and pallor,
embosoms the red-tiled roofs and white walls, of the
pretty little villas, perfumed by gardens where roses and
verbenas mingle with the citron and myrtle of a more
tropical flora. Here and there was a less pleasing spectacle—a
foretaste of that melancholy flavour which will
assert itself in the Ragusa of to-day. Once or twice we
came upon the deserted shell of what had been the
country seat of one of the merchant princes of the
palmier days of the republic, standing with ruinous
walls and charred rafters just as it was left seventy
years ago, when the barbarous Black Mountaineers and
Russians sacked the suburbs of Ragusa.</p>

<p>The road by which we ascended was lined with laburnums
and acacias. We passed two exquisite rocky coves,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383"></a>[383]</span>
revealing glimpses of blue sea far below us, and now began
to descend towards the city itself. We marvelled to see
amongst the rocks and gardens by the roadside, thickets
of rosy oleander, the spiry flowers of aloes, and here and
there a palm-tree flourishing in the open air. Then we
passed an open public garden with a brilliant array of
flowers; and just outside the Porta Pille, the land-gate of
Ragusa, we discovered, in a pleasant grove of plane-trees,
a small hotel, the Albergo al Boschetto, where we settle
down once more into civilized life, in a room overlooking
a beautiful gully of sea.</p>

<p>But how tenfold delightful are all these varying
beauties of sea and land to pilgrims like ourselves, fresh
from the terrible limestone wilderness of the interior!
What balm in this tropical luxuriance of flowers and
foliage to eyes dazed with the pitiless glare of naked
rocks! What peace in the rhythmic murmur of the waves
and ‘the unnumbered smile’ of the ocean below us! And
hardly less refreshing is it to the spirits of those—who,
like Childe Harold, have penetrated</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">—to find ourselves once more among associations as great
as any that ennoble the haunts of man.</p>

<p>Here, at last, after painfully exploring some of the
turbid streams and runnels of the mediæval civilisation
of Bosnia, we take our seat beside the fountain-head of
Illyrian culture. This is the city which claims as her
proudest title that she has been ‘the Athens of Illyria.’
This is the sweet interpreter between the wisdom of the
ancients and the rude Sclavonic mind, who acclimatized on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384"></a>[384]</span>
Dalmatian soil the flowers of Greek and Italian genius.
This is the nursing mother of those enterprising merchants
who in the Middle Ages laid bare the mineral
wealth of the Bosnian mountains, and infused the spirit
of commerce into their inmost recesses. This is ‘the Palmyra
between great empires,’ the City of Refuge which
received, within walls that never betrayed a fugitive, the
hunted remnants of Christian chivalry who, when Bosnia
was trodden down beneath the hoofs of the Infidel, preferred
exile to renegation.</p>

<p>For her allotted part of interpreter between Italian
and Sclave, Ragusa was fitted by her very origin.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> Her
citizens can trace their lineal descent from the inhabitants
of the Greco-Roman Republic of Epidaurus. When the
Sclavonic barbarians, descending from the mountains of
the interior, destroyed the ancient city of Epidaurus, the
Roman survivors emigrated in a body to the present site
of Ragusa, then a peninsular rock. Ragusa thus stands
to Epidaurus in the same filial relation in which Venice
stands to Aquileja and Patavium, and Spalato to Salona.</p>

<p>The site of the ancient Epidaurus, to exploring of
which I devoted a day of my sojourn here, lies on the
south-eastern horn of the bay on which Ragusa herself is
situated. The site is covered by a small modern town
called, by a strange transference of names, Ragusa Vecchia;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385"></a>[385]</span>
for the same pride of origin which induced the citizens of
mediæval Ragusa to style their city ‘Epidaura,’ led them
further to speak of their ancient Epidauritan seats as ‘Old
Ragusa.’</p>

<p>I took my place in the capacious <i>trabaccolo</i> which
fulfils the function of ferry-boat between New and Old
Ragusa, and a friendly Maestro filling our lateen sail as we
glided beyond the shelter of the Isle of Lacroma and the
haven of the Argosies, we had soon accomplished our
eight miles’ voyage, and were entering the harbour of
Ragusa Vecchia. This little town, in which most of the
relics of the ancient Epidaurus are discovered, lies on a
small two-humped peninsula, and is so nearly an island
that at one point the two seas are separated only by a
neck of land some dozen yards broad, and raised not
more than a foot or two above sea level. This answers
very well to the accounts of ancient Epidaurus which
have come down to us; for we read that the original city
was on an island till it was joined to the mainland by an
earthquake; and Procopius, writing in the sixth century,
tells us that Epidaurus had two harbours. Everywhere
around one seems to trace the volcanic activity which, to
the Greco-Roman city as well as to her offspring Ragusa,
was ever the most terrible foe. The rocks that start up
from the sea at the nose of the present peninsula are
but so many fragments from the wreck of the old Epidauran
site. Indeed, it is evident that Epidaurus covered
a much larger area than the site of Ragusa Vecchia can
supply; besides the remains on the peninsula, many, and
amongst them the tomb of a P. Cornelius Dolabella, have
come to light on the plain to the east about the modern
village of Obod, which, I take it, preserves, in a Sclavonic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386"></a>[386]</span>
disguise, the first two syllables of Epidaurus. In the adjoining
bay of St. Ivan the walls of the Roman houses
are, I was assured, distinctly visible beneath the surface
of the sea, which proves that here a great subsidence of
land has taken place within historic times.</p>

<p>At Ragusa Vecchia I found an intelligent peasant, who
took me round to show me all the old stones that were
known of in the place; and as others of the Ragusa Vecchian
inhabitants showed a good-natured readiness to aid
my search, and nobody minded my entering their abode, I
had soon seen quite a museum of Roman antiquities scattered
among old walls and cottage yards, and was so far
successful as to come upon some inscriptions that have not
been hitherto described,<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a> and at least one piece of sculpture
on which the antiquary’s eye had never gazed. There
were two antique bas-reliefs walled into the houses of the
quay—a Cupid, and a female figure, by a chariot, perhaps
intended for Amphitritè, but very badly executed. On a
column in another part of the town was a comic head of
good workmanship; and walled into a cottage yard a
very fine effigy of a Roman Signifer, holding an ensign,
and coifed in a lion-skin cap, like many standard-bearers
on Trajan’s Column, which this figure much recalled.
Our soldier was shod in curious sandals, and wore at his
side a short sword with a curved handle, much resembling
a modern Dalmatian knife.</p>

<p>On the peninsula I also saw nine more or less perfect
Roman inscriptions, one of considerable interest, as it bore
witness to the existence here of an <i>Ordo decurionatus</i> or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387"></a>[387]</span>
municipal senate. Other inscriptions were to be seen on
the mainland towards the village of Sveti Ivan, and the
owner of some oliveyards here showed me some mortuary
inscriptions engraved on the huge scattered blocks with
which the heights, which here rise above the sea, are
everywhere strewn. How terrible is the nakedness of
this land, where monuments stand ready for the graver!</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp48" id="illus51" style="max-width: 20.3125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/illus51.jpg" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p>Sculpture of Roman Standard-Bearer at Ragusa.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Overlooking the bay of St. Ivan, and the peninsula
of Ragusa Vecchia, rises a rocky hill known as the Colle
San Giorgio, up which I ascended to investigate a monument
which had accidentally been found there, not long
since, by a party of sailors belonging to the Greek communion.
The way in which in which it was discovered
is interesting, as it was due to the not altogether chance
coincidence of two superstitions. Just below the hill to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[388]</span>
the east is a Greek church, duly oriented; and the sailors,
standing against the wall at the west end, were gazing
idly at the hill in front, when a curious rock facing due
east caught their eye; and climbing up to examine it more
closely, they found that an ancient bas-relief was sculptured
on it, which they presently laid completely bare by pulling
away some rocks which had fallen against it. Nobody
could give me a clearer account of the design than that
it represented a man and a bull; but on arriving at the
spot, I found that it was, as I expected, a Mithraic
monument of a not unfrequent kind. The carving on the
slab, which was much mutilated and of very inferior art,
represented Mithra, in flowing mantle and tunic, sacrificing
a bull, on which he was kneeling in the usual attitude.
To the left and right of this central subject was an attendant—he
to the left holding out one arm, apparently
to hold the bull’s horn. Below this device the slab
seemed hollowed out, and though the rocks in front were
too large to remove without artificial aid, it seemed
quite possible that there might be a Mithraic cavern
underneath.</p>

<p>From this hill were pointed out to me the traces of
the ancient aqueduct of Epidaurus, which ran right across
the plain to the limestone mountain beyond. Here out
of the rock gushes a glacier-cool underground stream,
one of the effluents, it is supposed, of the Trebinjštica,
which the aqueduct once conveyed to the Greco-Roman
city. The plain through which it ran is still known as
<i>Canali</i> from this Roman work, and this whole district
was known to its early Sclavonic conquerors as the <i>Župa
Canawlovska</i>. Some remains of this work are to be seen
where it abuts on the rocky peninsula of Ragusa Vecchia,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389"></a>[389]</span>
but there is nothing here to remind one of the soaring
arches of Salona.</p>

<p>The point where the aqueduct abuts on the rock of
Ragusa Vecchia is, however, remarkable for other reasons.
It is just about here that quantities of antique gems have
been discovered, and one would suppose that this was
the lapidaries’ quarter of ancient Epidaurus. I have
looked through a great number of these, and have been
so fortunate as to obtain many, some here and some at
Ragusa. It is remarkable that the habit of wearing engraved
gems has survived among the peasants who occupy
the modern site of Epidaurus. The Ragusa-Vecchians
and Canalese take the ancient intaglios that they from time
to time pick up, and exchange them with the jewellers
of Ragusa for new gems of coarse Italian fabric! The engraved
stones found here are mostly carnelian, agate, sard,
bloodstone, onyx, and a few carbuncles. They are of
various qualities and dates; some, as can be told not only
from their execution, but from the Greek letters which appear
on them, dating back to the Hellenic period of Epidaurus;
but most are Roman, and of inferior workmanship.</p>

<p>Nor, as I have already pointed out, does Epidaurus
stand alone in this fecundity of gems. The same phenomenon,
to a greater or less extent, characterises the remains
of all the Roman sites in Illyria with which I am
acquainted. The sites of the ancient Narona, Salona, and
Ænona are equally prolific. From Salona there is a fine
selection in the museum at Spalato, and the Direttore,
Signor Glavinich, showed me one there which he believes
to represent an early king of Illyria.</p>

<p>Yet, as stones adapted for these ornamental purposes
are not to be found on the Dalmatian shores, it seems difficult<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[390]</span>
to account for their abundance on the Roman sites
of the coast-land. Whence were they derived?</p>

<p>The clue towards solving the mystery is, I think, to be
found in the abundance, in the interior of Bosnia and the
Herzegovina, of just the same stones engraved as Turkish
amulets and talismans, to which attention has been called
already. In parts of the Herzegovina these stones are
accounted so cheap that they are worn for merely ornamental
purposes. Some of the rayah women, who had
taken refuge in Ragusa from Nevešinje and the neighbouring
districts of the Herzegovina, wore broad belts
studded like ephods with suchlike stones. These were
mostly, like the antique gems of Epidaurus, carnelian and
agate, but I also noticed a few amethysts and one or two
roots-of-emerald; they were rudely cut, and none, as
far as I saw, engraved. On enquiring whence they came,
the women told me that they picked them up in their
own country, especially in a valley near Nevešinje. Here,
it seems to me, is the true clue to the origin of the Roman
intaglios. The raw material must have been gathered
in these inland valleys, and thence carried to Narona,
Epidaurus, and the other great coast cities, there to be
engraved with the elegant designs of classical mythology.
That there was a regular manufacture of such <i>bijouterie</i> in
the Roman cities of Dalmatia seems to be proved not only
by the great abundance of these gems on their sites, but
also by the fact that a very large proportion of these had
evidently never been set in rings and other articles of
jewellery, which would certainly be their ultimate destination.
In those found near the head of the aqueduct in
Ragusa Vecchia, we have doubtless the stock-in-trade of
some lapidary, probably lost during one of the earthquakes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391"></a>[391]</span>
from which the ancient city suffered; and Signor Glavinich
told me that he was convinced that Salona had been
the seat of a regular manufacture of Roman gems.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> Doubtless,
were there sufficient evidence forthcoming, it would
be found that Roman Dalmatia was the seat of an export
trade in such articles with other provinces of the empire.</p>

<p>Some of the gems which I obtained from the site of
Epidaurus bore allusion to the Mithraic cult, the existence
of which is witnessed to by the monument on the Colle
S. Giorgio. Two gems, one a bloodstone representing
Æsculapius with his serpent-staff; and another, a carnelian,
on which the same god of medicine stands side by
side with his companion Salus, were especially interesting
as bearing allusion to another Epidauritan cult of which
we have historic evidence.</p>

<p>The Illyrian Epidaurus laid equal claim with her two
Peloponnesian namesakes to be the chosen seat of the god
of healing, from whom the inhabitants of this part are
even said to have called themselves <i>Asklepitani</i>. The
temple of Æsculapius at the Saronic Epidaurus was indeed
of more world-wide celebrity among the ancients, and it
was from this that the cult was grafted on to Rome itself;
but perhaps if we knew more, it would be found that
this Illyrian city could boast a greater antiquity for her
worship. Here, at least, this form of serpent-worship
seems to fit on to another, the Phœnician origin of which
is beyond question, and which is intimately connected
with the earliest historic traditions of this coast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392"></a>[392]</span></p>

<p>This district has been identified with that of the
Encheleans, the Illyrian people with whom Cadmus and
his wife took refuge according to the legend. Near here,
according to ancient geographers, rose the rocks of
Cadmus and Harmonia, where was the sacred cavern in
which they were metamorphosed into dragons. Cadmus—whose
very name is equivalent to ‘the East’—was recognised
by the Greeks themselves as of Phœnician origin,
and the whole myth is generally accepted as bearing
reference to the civilising influence of Phœnician colonies
on the Hellenic border.</p>

<p>It certainly seems more than a coincidence that the
mythic account of Cadmus should connect him with this
part of Illyricum, where we know not only from historical
sources, but from actual remains, that Phœnician settlements
existed in very early times. One account of the
origin of the neighbouring city of Narona or Narbona
makes it a Phœnician colony; the island of Meleda,
whose ancient name is identical with that of the Phœnician
Malta, the island of Lagosta, and others contain
Phœnician inscriptions. What more natural than that the
serpent-worship of these coasts should have been derived
from the votaries of Esmun?</p>

<p>At the present day the Canalese peasants who inhabit
the district about the site of ancient Epidaurus differ
so essentially in face and form from the surrounding
Sclavonic races whose language they speak, and are
so Oriental in their appearance, that Appendini, the historian
of Ragusa, has recorded an opinion that they are
nothing else than descendants of the old Phœnician
colonists of this coast. He would be indeed a bold man
who should accept this theory without reserve, but I can<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393"></a>[393]</span>
bear the most emphatic testimony to the existence of a
strikingly Oriental type in this neighbourhood. In Ragusa
Vecchia itself the countenances struck me as of ordinary
Serbian or Italian types. But in the market-place
of Ragusa I noticed three peasant women whose faces bespoke,
as plainly as faces can speak, an entirely different
origin. On enquiring whence they came I found them
to be natives of the Golfo di Breno, a cove about three
miles distant from the site of Epidaurus. The faces were
strikingly alike. They were long and narrow, the nose
thin and long, very finely chiselled, and inclined to be
aquiline, their eyes black, and their tresses to match.
The big gold beads of her necklace, and the brilliant red
and orange kerchief that coifs her head, are the same
as those worn by her Serbo-Italian neighbours; but,
assuredly, the face of the girl I sketched is that of a
Syrian rather than a Serbian beauty!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394"></a>[394]</span></p>

<p>But to return to Cadmus. The modern Ragusa-Vecchians
and Canalese cling with obstinacy to the tradition
that a capacious cavern which opens beyond the Pianusa
Canalitana, on the limestone steep of Mt. Sniesnica, is
the very subterranean shrine where Cadmus and Harmonia
were metamorphosed into serpents, and where
afterwards Æsculapius kept his. It is still known as
the <i>Grotta d’Escolapio</i>. Being four hours distant from
Ragusa Vecchia, I had not opportunity to visit it; but
Appendini, who explored it, has left a curious account of
the cavern, which is very beautiful. Most interesting is
the way in which Sclavonic mythology has appropriated
the haunts of classical legend. The Vila herself, under a
thin Italian disguise, has taken up her abode in the cavern
of Cadmus and Æsculapius, and a religious awe falls on
the Canalese peasant as he points out the <i>Vasca della
Ninfa</i>. This is a natural vase formed by the stalagmite,
looking into which, Appendini descried beneath the water
three coins—offerings, doubtless, made to the goddess of
the grot by her peasant votaries; but when this impious
mortal would have put forth his hand and taken them
up, his terrified guide restrained him—<i>he knew</i> that the
cavern would close its jaws on whoever should attempt
to carry off the Vila’s treasure.</p>

<p>I heard of another cave also associated with Æsculapius
in the peninsula of Ragusa Vecchia itself, and as
there is a strange fascination about caverns, with or without
legendary associations, I hastened to explore it. A
corps of observation was soon organised among the
natives, so that, guided by a party armed with candles
and torches, I presently found myself at the opening of
the cavern. To arrive at the actual entrance you have to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395"></a>[395]</span>
drop a few feet into a crevice of the rocks, which are
overgrown with a profusion of beautiful true maidenhair
fern.<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> We then penetrated through a narrow mouth,
and the light of the torches revealed a spacious rock
chamber with a rapidly descending floor. The descent
was now rather risky; the men had to feel carefully every
step, as the slightest slip sets in motion a miniature avalanche,
and pebbles set rolling bound down to an unfathomed
pool below, in which several people have been
drowned. We were not able to reach the water, but it
is quite possible that there exist other once accessible
pools, the avenues to which have been blocked up with
breccia. If so, this may well have been the cavern from
which, in the fourth century, the Epidauritans (whose
aqueduct we may suppose had already been cut off by
earthquakes or barbarian foes) were wont to obtain their
supply of fresh water. In that case I had been exploring
the haunts of another most terrific serpent—this time of
Christian mythology.</p>

<p>About the year of grace 365—St. Jerome be my witness!—Epidaurus
and its inhabitants were in a very bad
way.</p>

<p>Now hard-by Epidaurus was a certain cave called
<i>Scipum</i>, in which they of that city were wont to draw
water. And in this cave a grievous dragon<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> called <i>Boas</i>
had taken his abode, and wrought much slaughter both
of men and cattle. And it came to pass that St. Hilarion
entered the city, and when he saw that they of that place
quaked and feared, for the dragon was of huge and
monstrous size, he bade them be of good heart, for that
he would slay the fiend. Now Epidaurus was yet pagan.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396"></a>[396]</span>
Therefore St. Hilarion gat him to the mouth of the cavern,
and having made the sign of the holy cross, he cried with
a loud voice and saith unto the monster, ‘Come forth.’ But
when the dragon Boas heard the voice of the holy man,
then quailed his heart within him, and he came forth.
Then saith St. Hilarion unto the dragon, ‘Follow me.’
And the dragon followed him, and he went on foot till
he came to a place called ‘the mills,’ which is distant
from the city three miles and fifty paces. And when they
were come there, St Hilarion saith unto them of Epidaurus
that went with him, ‘Make now a pyre that we
may consume the monster and his works.’ And the pyre
being now made, St. Hilarion saith unto the dragon Boas,
‘Get thee on to the pyre.’ And the dragon gat him on to
the pyre. Then was fire set to the pyre that the dragon
was utterly consumed. But they of Epidaurus, when they
saw what salvation was wrought for them by the holy
man, rejoiced in spirit. And at that spot which is called
‘the mills’ they built a temple to the honour and praise
of St. Hilarion. And once in every year, at a set season,
there went thither much people from Epidaurus, and
offered worship unto St. Hilarion, singing pagan hymns,
and before sundown returned to their own city.</p>

<p>So much for the true and faithful legend of St.
Hilarion; and if anyone doubts its veracity, let him know
that the mills are to be seen unto this day, and that the
village hard-by them, S. Ilarione, preserves the name<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a>
of the saintly dragon-slayer, who, I may add, is still held
in great veneration by the Ragusan church. But how interesting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397"></a>[397]</span>
is this personified triumph of Christianity over
the Cadmean and Æsculapian serpent-worship of earlier
Epidaurus!—how suggestive is this annexation of local
mythology by the new religion!</p>

<p>It may be believed that after this miracle the faith
grew in Epidaurus, especially when, twenty years afterwards,
St. Hilarion followed up his first success by once
more appearing as saviour of the city. In the year 385,
we are told there was a grievous earthquake, and the
waves were piled up like mountains, and threatened to
engulf Epidaurus. But the saint graved three crosses in
the sand of the seashore,
and the ocean, which hearkened
not to Cnut, obeyed
Hilarion. Christian bishops
of Epidaurus are mentioned
in the sixth and seventh
centuries, and we hear of
one nine years before the
final overthrow and transplantation
of the city. I
did not notice any Christian
monuments on the site of Epidaurus of Roman date; but
I was pleased to find in a cottage of Ragusa Vecchia, built
into the interior wall of an upper room, a very beautiful
monument of mediæval Christian art, which I have here
attempted to represent. It was known to the cottagers
as the ‘Bambino,’ and represents the Mother and Child;
but the influence of classical art is strongly marked, and
though the tenderness of the whole design is Italian, the
head of the Virgin might have been mistaken for a heathen
goddess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398"></a>[398]</span></p>

<p>As early as <span class="allsmcap">A.D.</span> 550 the Sclaves had begun to annoy
Epidauras, but it was not till the year 656 that the city
finally yielded, it is said to a combined attack, on land
by the heathen Narentines and Terbunians, and from
the sea by Saracen corsairs from Africa. Then it was
that the survivors of the Roman population fled to the
rocky site on the other horn of the gulf on which Ragusa
stands. Every morning the same migration from Old to
New Ragusa takes place on a smaller scale. A bevy of
bright Canalese market-women, in their clean white crenellated
caps, and their more sombre husbands—who, with
their black turbans, jackets, and trouser-leggings, look
like Turks in mourning—embark before dawn in the broad
<i>trabaccolo</i>, that they may sell their fruit and vegetables
in the Ragusan market. In their company I will return
to Ragusa and her history.</p>

<p>The rock on which the refugees from Epidaurus laid
the foundations of what is now Ragusa, is said originally
to have been an island, though it is now only a peninsula.
Ragusa herself owes her name, according to Constantine
Porphyrogenitus,<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> to the Greek word Λαῦ, signifying
‘rock,’ and the fact that the rock on which the original
city was built was known long afterwards as ‘Lavve’ is
rather favourable to the Byzantine etymology. Thus,
both her name and origin are representative of the
rôle which the city was to play throughout her earlier
history, and to which she owes so much of her greatness.
Like ancient Rome, Ragusa began life as an
asylum. She was at first a rock of refuge for the survivors
from the wrecks of Roman coast-cities of Dalmatia.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399"></a>[399]</span>
The fugitives from Epidaurus obtained citizen recruits
from those inhabitants of Salona who, when their city
was destroyed, did not trust to the walls of Diocletian’s
palace for security, or could not find room there. Later
on, when the Roman cities that occupied the sites of the
present towns of Rizano, Cattaro, Budua, and other places
on the Bocche di Cattaro and the Albanian coast, were
ravaged by the Saracen corsairs, a new influx of Roman
refugees set in to Ragusa.</p>

<p>Ragusa was thus originally Roman. Her necessities
led her to ally with the Eastern Empire against the
Saracen corsairs, and, however little real authority the
Byzantine Emperors possessed within her walls, Constantine
Porphyrogenitus places Rausium among the imperial
cities on the Dalmatian coast. But this Roman coast-city,
with her inheritance of ancient civilisation, was already
consummating that alliance with the ruder energies of
the Sclavonic mainland, to which her future eminence
was so largely due.</p>

<p>The barren mountain which frowns so abruptly over
Ragusa on the land-side, was once covered with an immemorial
pinewood,<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> which stretched over a large part
of what is now included in the mediæval walls of Ragusa.
It was in this wood that a Sclavonic colony settled, outside
the Roman rock stronghold, and as in process of
time the two populations blended, <i>Dubrava</i>—which signifies
‘the wood,’ and had been the name given by the
Sclaves to their colony outside the walls—was attached to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400"></a>[400]</span>
the whole city, so that Ragusa is still known to the Sclavonic
world as <i>Dubrovnik</i>—the forest town.</p>

<p>For long the new rock asylum is engaged in a life-and-death
struggle with the Saracen corsairs, who desolated
the Dalmatian and Albanian coasts. Generally,
still Roman Ragusa turns to the Byzantine Empire as her
natural protector; but for a moment we see dimly reflected
in her saga the influence of the revived Empire of
the West; and one may, perhaps, be allowed to see in it
a witness to the authority which for a while the great
Carl succeeded in extending over the Illyrian Sclaves.
We were surprised to find in the more classic court of the
Palazzo Rettorale here, a colossal statue such as one meets
with often enough beneath the quaint gables of a North-German
Rathhaus. It was, in fact, a Ragusan Rolandsäule.
According to the Ragusan annalists, Orlando, or
Rolando, the sister’s son of Carl the Great, and a brave
Paladin, had heard in Bretagne, where he was governor,
that Saracen corsairs were ravaging the Roman towns
of the Adriatic. Orlando at once set out for Ragusa,
embarked on board a Ragusan galley, won a sea-victory
over the Saracen pirates off the island of Lacroma
opposite, took their Emir Spucento captive, and cut off
his head in Ragusa. Thereupon the grateful Ragusans
set up then and there a marble statue of Orlando, which
remains unto this day.<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401"></a>[401]</span></p>

<p>Another time the treacherous Venetians prepare to
surprise Ragusa under the pretence of provisioning their
ships. But St. Blasius, of Armenia, appears to a priest
in a dream and warns him of the danger to the city. The
priest gave the alarm, the walls were manned in time,
and Ragusa showed her gratitude to her preserver by
choosing him as her patron saint. A church was reared
to St. Blasius, his effigy was placed on the great seal,
the banners, and coins of the Republic, and his miraculous
interposition was commemorated every year at the feast
of the Purification.</p>

<p>This is not the place to trace out all the ‘dim complicacities’
of Ragusa’s earlier history. Ragusa was by birthright
a City of Refuge, and her rise was mainly due to the
wise and heroic policy of defending at any cost her rights
of hospitality. Whether it be the children of the rightful
king of Serbia, or the widowed queen of Dalmatia, or the
Bosnians who had fled from the wrath of their Ban, all
alike obtain shelter from their pursuers within these hospitable
walls. Again and again Ragusa consented to see
her territory ravaged and her walls beleaguered for the
protection which her Senate accorded to the unfortunate.
When Bodin, the Grand Župan of Serbia, Rascia, and
Bosnia, then at the height of his power, demanded the
extradition of the sons of the Serbian prince whose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402"></a>[402]</span>
dominion he had usurped,<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a> and threatened in case of refusal
‘to fly his eagle to the destruction of Ragusa,’ the
Senate nobly replied ‘that it was the custom of their city
to refuse asylum to no man, but to protect everyone who
fled to them in misfortune.’ On this occasion Ragusa
underwent a seven years’ siege.</p>

<p>Even those who had been the bitterest enemies to the
Republic were glad in less prosperous days to throw themselves
on a hospitality that never failed. Bogoslave, the
king of Dalmatia, had besieged Ragusa with 10,000 men
for sheltering the widowed queen, Margarita; but when,
on his death, his widowed queen and son were driven
forth from their country, Ragusa did not hesitate to give
them shelter, too. Stephen Némanja, the Grand Župan of
Serbia and Rascia, who had twice laid siege to Ragusa,
once with an army of 20,000 horse and 30,000 foot,
seeing himself likely to be worsted in his struggle with
the Byzantine Emperor, sent to ask the senate of Ragusa
if he, too, should be allowed to claim their right of asylum,
and obtained permission to retire here with his family
if defeated; and that, though his adversary was allied to
the republic.</p>

<p>A city strong enough and generous enough to shelter
the unfortunate on either side could not fail to find many
well-wishers among the neighbouring peoples and princes;
and though Ragusa suffered much in defence of her privilege
of asylum, she won more. Silvester, a king of Dalmatia,
who had found shelter within her walls, on recovering
power, testified his gratitude by presenting Ragusa with
the islands of Calamotta, Mezzo, and Giupan. Stephen, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403"></a>[403]</span>
former king, in return for hospitality conferred on him as
a voluntary guest, made over to the Republic the neighbouring
coast-lands from the Val-di-noce to Epidaurus.
The good relations which she cultivated with the Bosnians,
and the gratitude of the Némanjas, enabled Ragusa
to lay the foundations of her commercial eminence in the
heart of Illyria; and in 1169 two Ragusan merchants
built a factory on the site of what has since become the
capital of Bosnia.</p>

<p>But Ragusa obtained one reward for hospitality to a
royal stranger which must claim an especial interest from
Englishmen. Richard Cœur-de-Lion, during his ill-fated
voyage from the Holy Land, overtaken by a storm in the
Adriatic, vowed that he would build a church at the spot
where he should reach land in safety. He landed on the
small rocky island of Lacroma, which lies opposite the old
port of Ragusa. But he was conducted to the neighbouring
city of Ragusa with great pomp by the Senate, and
entertained with such profuse hospitality and magnificent
shows, that he yielded to the prayers of the Ragusans,
and obtained a dispensation from the Pope, to build the
promised church in Ragusa itself, though it appears that
his Holiness made him build a small church on Lacroma
as well. The church which was now built with English
money (though Richard had to borrow for the purpose),
was the old cathedral of Ragusa. For beauty it was unrivalled
in Illyria,<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> but unfortunately no trace of it now
remains, as it was entirely destroyed by the earthquake
of 1667.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404"></a>[404]</span></p>

<p>The year 1203 marks a new epoch in the history of
Ragusa. In this year the Rector of the Republic, Damiano
Juda, endeavoured to prolong his government beyond
the year for which he had been elected. By the
help of the popular party he succeeded in retaining the
supreme authority for two years, and became so obnoxious
to the nobles, that considering the suzerainty of
a foreign state to be preferable to the tyranny of a fellow-citizen,
they held a secret conclave in which it was
decided to invoke the aid of Venice. The Venetians,
whose power from the recent conquest of Constantinople
was then at its zenith, accepted the overtures of the Ragusan
nobles. Damiano was decoyed on board a Venetian
ship, where, on finding himself a prisoner, he committed
suicide; and Lorenzo Quirini, the nominee of Venice, was
introduced as Count of the Republic. But Ragusa never
sank like Zara or Spalato, and the other Dalmatian cities,
under Venetian domination. Quirini had only been received
on condition that Ragusa should preserve her ancient
liberties. When the Ragusans began to perceive an intention
on the part of the Venetian Count to violate this agreement
they turned him out; and though they once more
received a nominee of Venice in 1232, the relation of the
Ragusans to Venice was rather that of a free ally than
that of a dependent. It was indeed stipulated that the
Doge and a majority of the Venetian Senate should nominate
the Count of Ragusa, that her archbishop should be
born on Venetian territory, and that her citizens should
swear fealty to the Doge; but Ragusa retained the right
of conducting her own affairs by means of her Senate, of
which the Count was only president; she was still governed
by her own laws; her own flag floated from her walls,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405"></a>[405]</span>
and she struck her own coins with the effigy of St. Blasius.
The treaty stipulates that both states are to have the same
friends and foes; but towards Venetian expeditions beyond
the Adriatic, Ragusa was only to contribute one
thirtieth. So free indeed was Ragusa, that in fact she
never accepted Venetian archbishops; and in 1346 the
Venetian <i>Conte</i> was forced to look on and see the republic
transfer its suzerainty to the new Serbian empire
of Czar Dūshan.</p>

<p>Thus it was that Ragusa, though for a while under
Venetian overlordship, never, like the other Dalmatian
cities, saw her native institutions swept away by Venice.
At the present day, at Cattaro or Spalato, along the
Dalmatian coast-land on each side of Ragusa, you hear
the Venetian dialect; at Ragusa the language is pure
Tuscan. St. Blasius, and not the lion of St. Mark,
adorns the mediæval walls and gates of Ragusa. On the
other hand, in costume, manners, and the form of government,
the Venetian influence here has been very
perceptible.</p>

<p>It is about the time of the Venetian suzerainty that
the government becomes finally fixed.</p>

<p>Ragusa had doubtless originally inherited her aristocratic-republican
institutions<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> from the <i>municipales</i> of
ancient Epidaurus. Her Senate, which we hear of in
very early days, is doubtless, like the Senates of Arles,
Nismes, Vienne, and the other great cities of Languedoc
and Provence, but a continuation of the Roman
<i>Curia</i>, of whose existence in Epidaurus we have both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406"></a>[406]</span>
historic and epigraphic proof. Her patricians could no
doubt trace back their ancestry to the late Roman Honorati;
they were twitted, indeed, with tracing it back to
Jupiter!</p>

<p>From the time of the Venetian suzerainty onwards,
the government is vested in three councils, and the city
divided into three orders: the Nobili or Patrizj, the Cittadini,
divided into the two <i>Confraternite</i> of S. Antonio
and S. Lazzaro; lastly the Artigiani, who appear to
have stood to the Cittadini much as our craft-guilds
to the merchant-guilds. The government was entirely
aristocratic; the Cittadini could indeed fill some public
offices,<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> but the appointments were reserved for the
Senate.</p>

<p>The body in which the sovereignty ultimately rested
was the Gran Consiglio,<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> including all the members of the
nobility who had reached the legal age of eighteen, and
whose names were registered in the <i>Specchio di Maggior
Consiglio</i>, a Ragusan <i>Libro d’Oro</i>. This body elected,
every month, the Rector of the Republic, and, annually,
all the great magistrates, imposed the customs and ordinary
taxes, confirmed or abolished laws, and possessed the power
of pardoning and passing sentence of death.</p>

<p>The more ordinary functions of government were in
the hands of two smaller bodies. The Senate, or <i>Consiglio
de’ Pregati</i>, composed of forty-five members, drew up
the laws and imposed extraordinary and indirect taxes,
appointed ambassadors and consuls, decided on peace or
war, treated of important state affairs, and acted as a court
of appeal. The Senate met four times a week, and on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407"></a>[407]</span>
occasions of emergency. The members were elected for
life from its body by the Gran Consiglio, but were confirmed
in their office every year by this greater council,
and sometimes a Senator was suspended by it from his
functions.</p>

<p>Lastly, the Minor Consiglio, consisting of seven
senators and the Rettore of the Republic, acted as the executive
of the greater council, exercised judicial authority
on greater cases, received ambassadors, and treated with
foreign Powers.<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> The Rettore of the Republic, who presided
over this body, held office only a month, during
which time he was bound to reside perpetually in the
Palazzo Rettorale, only leaving it on public occasions.<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> He
was clad in a long red robe, with a black stole over his
shoulders as a sign of supreme authority, kept the keys
of the city, the archives of the Republic, and convoked
the Gran Consiglio and Senate. As a further constitutional
precaution, thoroughly Venetian, three magistrates, called
Provveditori della Repubblica, were chosen, who were
superior to all but the Senate and Greater Council, and
who possessed the right of suspending laws and decrees,
and their execution till the Senate had re-examined
them.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a></p>

<p>Truly, from a constitutional point of view, Ragusa
deserved her title of <i>Piccola Venezia</i>! But the aristocratic
government at Ragusa worked with even greater
smoothness than at Venice. Though the rule of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408"></a>[408]</span>
Ragusan patricians had endured for nigh seven centuries
before the time of Damiano Juda, and was prolonged
for over five centuries after his date, it was only broken by
this solitary revolution.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> Take into consideration the small
size of the city, and the stability of the Ragusan constitution
becomes the more remarkable. Here there was no
room for feudal lords living on their own domains, amidst
their own retainers, protected and secluded by moats and
castle walls. The nobles of Ragusa elbowed their fellow-citizens
in the same narrow streets; and these fellow-citizens,
far from being ignorant serfs, were often their
equals in education and their superiors in wealth. Yet
the Cittadini and Artigiani of Ragusa were content to leave
the reins of government in the hands of an aristocratic caste,
and that caste was so exclusive that during eight hundred
years there is no single instance recorded of a <i>mésalliance</i>
with the bourgeoisie.</p>

<p>The secret lies in the sober genius of both the nobles
and people of Ragusa, and in that elevated conception of
patriotism which linked it with their religion. A judicial
gravity presides over the whole constitutional history of
Ragusa. The governing classes looked on their authority,
not as a mere prize of birth, but as a sacred trust. The
prayer for the magistrates of the Republic, which opens the
Ragusan <i>Libro d’Oro</i>, breathes that exalted spirit which
animated all classes of Ragusan citizens from first to last.
‘O Lord, Father Almighty, who hast chosen this Commonwealth
to Thy service, choose, we beseech Thee, our governors
according to Thy will and our necessity; that so,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409"></a>[409]</span>
fearing Thee and keeping Thy holy commandments, they
may cherish and direct us in true charity. Amen.’<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a></p>

<p>Turn where we will among the pages of Ragusan
history, we find ourselves amongst a grave and sober
people—a people who are never carried away with
success, and who support adversity with calm endurance.
The heroes of Ragusa are of the majestic Roman type,
and her greatest is a second Regulus. Her peculiar genius
reflects itself in her arts and sciences, which are severe
and practical. Her Senate forbids the erection of a
theatre. The fine arts here fall into the background,
and mathematics, mechanics, and astronomy take the
lead. Ragusan nobles are mathematicians, and her poets
are also merchants; the masterpieces of her muse are
stately epics. Her sympathies are with the dignified
spirit of the East, and the noblest homage of her bards is
rendered to a Turkish Grand Signior. But Ragusa nowhere
displayed the severe gravity of her manners more
conspicuously than in the education of her children.
Palladius,<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> writing in the middle of the fifteenth century,
says of the Ragusans: ‘To make manifest how great is the
severity and diligence of the Ragusans in the bringing up
of their children, one thing I will not pass over, that they
suffer no exercises to exist in the city, but literary. And
if jousters or acrobats approach they are forthwith cast
out, lest the youth (which they would keep open for
letters or for merchanding) be corrupted by such low<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410"></a>[410]</span>
exhibitions.’ Truly, in mediæval Ragusa, Jack must have
been a dull boy!</p>

<p>The same sober and religious spirit asserts itself in
the laws, and the philanthropic and industrial institutions
of mediæval Ragusa. Few indeed were the towns which
could boast of a City Police and Sanitary Board in the
middle ages! There was a ‘Curates’ Augmentation Fund’
here in the fourteenth century;<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> this city lays claim
to having possessed the first foundling hospital<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> and the
first loan-bank in the civilised world, and the annual
revenues of the pious institutions of Ragusa amounted
to 800,000 ducats. If we except the early English
legislation which put a stop to the human exports of
Bristol, Ragusa was the first state to pass laws abolishing
the slave trade. In the year 1416 the great council of
Ragusa, hearing that several Ragusan merchants residing
on the Narenta were in the habit of selling those under
them as slaves, passed a law—by a majority of seventy-five
in a house of seventy-eight—that anyone who henceforth
sold a slave should be liable to a fine and six
months’ imprisonment: ‘Considering such traffic to be
base, wicked, and abominable, and contrary to all
humanity, and to redound to the no small disgrace of
our city—namely, that the human form, made after the
image and similitude of our Creator, should be turned to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411"></a>[411]</span>
mercenary profit, and sold as if it were brute beast.<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a>
During the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries,
large sums were left by philanthropic citizens of
Ragusa to be spent in purchasing the freedom of slaves.</p>

<p>Perhaps the stability of the Ragusan government is
due as much to her peculiar situation as to the sobriety
of her citizens. Ragusa is well described by mediæval
writers as a ‘Palmyra between great empires.’ She had
to preserve her independence in turn from Byzantine
Cæsars, the pirate state of the Narentines, the queen of
the Adriatic, the Serbian Czar, the kings of Hungary,
and finally from the Turks and Spaniards. She had to be
perpetually on her guard against the ambitious designs
of the most powerful states of the mediæval world. When
her neighbours quarrelled, she was continually placed in
the most difficult position, and the ramifications of her
trade put her at the mercy of the most remote assailant.
Thus it was that in her government foreign affairs were
of supreme importance; there was constant necessity for
secret discussion, prompt decision, and the wisdom of a
hereditary caste of statesmen. A state whose empire is
mercantile must be mighty indeed to afford the luxury of
popular government. Ragusa was too small, too closely
bordered by powerful empires; and the sterling sense of
her citizens acquiesced in the necessity of an aristocratic
constitution.</p>

<p>Nothing, indeed, is more wonderful in the history of
the Republic than the tact with which these hereditary
diplomatists conducted foreign affairs. In an earlier stage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412"></a>[412]</span>
of her history, and a ruder state of society, we have seen
the obstinacy with which the Senate clung to the Ragusan
rights of asylum. In a later and more diplomatic age
the City of Refuge becomes the champion of the rights of
neutrals. We are lost in wonder at the skill with which
the Republic preserves its neutrality between Venice and
the Greeks, Venice and the Narentines, Venice and the
Hungarians; between the Serbian Czar and Byzantine
Cæsar, between the Turks and the Hungarians, the Turks
and the Venetians, the Turks and the fleets of Charles V.
It appears to have been a secret of Ragusan policy to
yield a certain suzerainty to that Power which was strong
on the mainland. While Venice is omnipotent in Dalmatia,
Ragusa recognizes the overlordship of the Doge;
Czar Dūshan stretches the Serbian empire to the sea, and
Ragusa transfers to him her homage. The Serbian empire
breaks up; the Hungarian flag floats on the walls of the
Dalmatian cities in place of the lion of St. Mark; and
from 1358 to 1483 Ragusa accepts the suzerainty of the
kings of Hungary. But with admirable perception the
statesmen of Ragusa turn towards the rising sun; and
already, in 1370, when the rest of Eastern Europe was
hardly conscious of the existence of its future conquerors,
the Ragusans sent an embassy to Broussa, in Asia Minor, to
the successor of Orchan,<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> Emir of the Turks, in which, in
return for a yearly payment of 500 sequins, they obtained
a firman of trade privileges, still preserved in the archives
of Ragusa, and laid the foundations of a friendship which
afterwards saved the small Republic when the empire of
Byzantium, the despotates of Serbia and Albania, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413"></a>[413]</span>
kingdoms of Hungary and Bosnia, were swept away. The
treaty was renewed with Bajazet, and on his final conquest
of the Herzegovina in 1483, Ragusa, true to her policy,
transfers her suzerainty to the Porte.</p>

<p>It was the vast commerce of Ragusa with the interior
of the Balkan peninsula which made her government so
sedulous in securing friendly relations with the dominant
power of the mainland. The citizens were repaid tenfold
for their deference to the ruling caste by the benefits
which their trade reaped from the keen foresight and
the marvellous powers of negotiation displayed by their
government. The friendship of Serbian, Bosnian, Hungarian,
and later on of Turkish potentates, enabled them
to plant their factories throughout the Sclavonic lands
that lie between the Adriatic and the Black Sea. At the
time of the Turkish conquests the Ragusans possessed
mercantile colonies at the Serai in Bosnia, Novipazar in
Rascia, Novibrdo and Belgrade in Serbia, at Bucharest and
Tirgovisce in Wallachia, at Widdin, Rustchuk, Silistria, and
Sophia in Bulgaria, and in the original capital of Turkey-in-Europe,
Adrianople. To these colonies the Turks conceded
a special jurisdiction, and even the right to build
cathedral churches. Ragusan caravans passed without
let or hindrance throughout all these lands; and the Pope
himself granted the Ragusans permission to trade with
the infidels. An astounding monument of the industry
of these colonists is found in a treaty between George
Branković, despot of Serbia, and the Republic, by which
the Ragusan government leased the working of the three
gold mines of Novibrdo, Janovo, and Kratovo, for a
yearly rent of 300,000 ducats—an enormous sum for
those days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414"></a>[414]</span></p>

<p>Besides this trade with the Sclavonic interior, Ragusa
conducted a maritime traffic with the Levant, and as early
as the beginning of the fourteenth century had concluded
treaties of commerce with the sultans of Egypt, Syria,
Iconia, and Bythinia. Ragusan factories existed in the
great Italian cities of the Romagna, the Marches, and
Abbruzzo, and throughout Sicily and Naples, and much
of the transit trade between those countries and the
Levantine ports was conducted in Ragusan bottoms. Of
these commercial colonies in Italy, the most important
was that which gave the name <i>Strada de’ Ragusei</i> to a
street of Florence, and the Messinese, established at
Syracuse, which gave the name of Ragusa to a castle that
rose above the ruins of Camarina. Her merchants penetrated
not only to France and Spain, but even to our shores,
whence they transported English wares, especially cloths
and woollens, to the south and east.<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> Ragusan merchants
were settled in England in the sixteenth century, and later
on Cromwell granted the Ragusans trade privileges in
English ports. The mighty merchantmen of Ragusa ‘with
portly sail, like signiors and rich burghers of the flood,’<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a>
have added a word to the English language. Our ‘argosy,’<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a>
once written ‘<i>Ragosie</i>,’ meant originally nothing
but a Ragusan carrack. Nor was it only in the peaceful
paths of commerce that our forefathers made acquaintance
with the stately vessels of Ragusa. As the price of many
trade privileges, the Republic was forced to recruit the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415"></a>[415]</span>
navies of Spain with her ships and take part in her enterprises.
The loftiest carracks in the Spanish Armada sailed
forth from the old harbour of Ragusa, and in 1596 twelve
Ragusan three-masters fought the English in the Indian
Ocean.</p>

<p>By the end of the fifteenth century the commercial
bloom of Ragusa had reached its prime, and the city
must have been amongst the most flourishing in Europe.
As early as 1450 the merchant navy of Ragusa consisted
of 300 vessels. ‘There is no part of Europe,’ says the
contemporary Palladius, ‘so hidden or so hostile to
strangers that you will not find there merchants of
Ragusa.’ And this commercial prosperity abroad was
supplemented by manufacturing enterprise at home.</p>

<p>In 1490 a Florentine weaver was called in to instruct
the Ragusans in cloth-weaving. Mills were built, a
Neapolitan constructed a conduit to aid the dyeing,
machinery was set in motion by water-power, and in five
years a new manufacture was in full operation. A few years
later<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> the silk manufacture was introduced by an enterprising
citizen of Ragusa from Tuscany. Besides these
and such minor industries as supplied the neighbouring
Turkish provinces with wax, hides, salt, and sandals, there
was the cannon foundry, the powder mill, the docks, the
coral fishery, the glass manufactory, and the production
of that filagree work of gold and silver, in which the
Ragusans excelled, to divide the energies of the citizens.
At the end of the fifteenth century the population of
Ragusa is reckoned at 40,000, the treasury of the
Republic is said to have contained a reserve of seven
million sequins, and the merchants of a single quarter of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416"></a>[416]</span>
the city, called Prieko, were possessed of capital amounting
to two hundred million ducats.</p>

<p>At this time an additional lustre is shed over the ancient
City of Refuge by the nobility of those who sought refuge
within her walls. After the fall of Constantinople and the
overthrow of the Sclavonic kingdoms of the interior, Ragusa
was thronged with fugitive princes of Eastern Europe.
Scions of the imperial houses of Byzantium, the families
of Lascaris and Cantacuzene, the Comneni and Palæologi,
the wife of the Despot of Serbia, the widowed Queen of
Bosnia, with a host of lesser rank, sought and found a
haven in these hospitable streets; and the name of
Stephen, duke of St. Sava, is still to be seen inscribed on
the roll of Ragusan nobility in the Specchio del Maggior
Consiglio.</p>

<p>But the greatest glory of Ragusa lies neither in her
wealth nor her princely hospitality, but rather in the
civilizing influence which she exercised over the most
barbarous European member of our Aryan family.
It is the literature of Ragusa that lives still in the minds
of men in days when her commerce has deserted her,
and her own nobility has been extinguished with her
liberty.</p>

<p>We have seen Ragusa by her very birth partly Roman
and partly Sclave. Bit by bit the ‘city of the rock’ becomes
fused with the forest-town outside. In her vast
and varied intercourse with the Sclavonic interior Roman
Ragusa becomes Serbian Dubrovnik. From the beginning
of the fourteenth century the Serbian language, so vigorously
proscribed by earlier laws, may be considered the
mother-tongue of Ragusa. In 1472 the Sclavonic language
became so dominant that even the Senate had to pass a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417"></a>[417]</span>
law enforcing Italian as the language of their deliberations.
Thus Ragusa became a Sclavonic city at the very
moment when her extended connection with the rest of
Europe, and especially with Italy, brought her into the
full current of the Western Renascence. She had become
Sclavonic, but she never lost the Italian side to her character.
Her wealthy citizens, though they spoke the
Serbian dialect of Dubrovnik in their family circles, sent
their children to the Florentine schools, and, just as
educated Irishmen and Welshmen often speak the best
English, so, to this acquired knowledge of Italian, is
largely due that purity of accent which has preserved
the Italian of Ragusa from the Venetian and Dalmatian
barbarisms of the other cities of this coast, and which
makes it still the <i>lingua Toscana in bocca Ragusea</i>.</p>

<p>Ragusa was thus fitted by her very composition to be
the interpreter between the Italian and Sclavonic minds,
and to give birth to that literature which has won for
her the title of ‘the Sclavonic Athens.’ The magistrates
of the Republic, true to the same wise policy which had
founded her schools, invited hither the most learned men
of Italy, and towards the end of the fifteenth century
many were enticed to Ragusa as professors, chancellors,
and secretaries. Nascimbeno di Nascimbeni, the celebrated
philologist, was invited here as rector of the school,
and Demetrius Chalcochondylas deserted Florence herself
to accept the chair of Greek at Ragusa. For Ragusan
culture was something more than a mere reflection of the
Italian Renascence, and the exiled scholars of Byzantium
flocked hither as to a city which had held literary communion
with their own, centuries before the days of its
captivity, and whose inhabitants were in some sort their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418"></a>[418]</span>
fellow-citizens. As early as the year 1170 the Ragusans
had been admitted citizens of Constantinople by Manuel
Comnenus, and the Imperial Chamber had undertaken to
defray the expense of educating a certain number of
Ragusan youths in Greek learning. By the beginning of
the fourteenth century Ragusa herself had become a
school of Greek for the Serbian mainland. Sclavonic
Kings and Czars sent hither the young barons of their
realms to be instructed in learning and manners; and the
Serbian Czar, Stephen Dūshan, presented the city with a
precious collection of codices, Greek and Latin, discovered
in the Illyrian interior.<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> Thus the citizens of Ragusa
were in every way well fitted to play a leading part in the
revival of letters in Western Europe; it is said that in the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries there was not one of her
families but could boast its man of letters; her scholars
toiled eagerly at the new learning, and emended the texts
of Virgil, Ovid, Cicero, and other classical authors. It
is extremely significant of the position held by Ragusa in
the world of letters at the end of the fifteenth century,
that Aldus Manutius sent his son Paolo here for his classical
schooling.</p>

<p>But this erudition was but the prelude to an outburst
of original genius such as has been paralleled by few cities
of the globe. Perhaps, indeed, no other people had
brought before them so vividly every stirring aspect of
the most romantic age that the world has seen. The
Ragusans had sat at the feet of Byzantine masters in days
when learning was their insolent monopoly; they had
already been familiarised in the schools of Florence with
the masterpieces of Italian genius; they had caught from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419"></a>[419]</span>
Virgil and Ovid an inspiration of antiquity; and the
dramas of Sophocles had been translated by a fellow-citizen
into their Serbian mother-tongue. To these
creations of exotic fancy they added, what they had never
lost, a heritage of Serbian poetry, enshrining a mythology
that had felt in some mysterious way the spell of Arabian
genii—a mythology still so real that, to the last days of
the Commonwealth, effigies of fantastic Serbian deities,
and amongst them the ‘flowery-kirtled’ Vila, were borne in
procession at Ragusan carnivals.<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> The merchant-citizens of
the Republic had already enlarged their sympathies with
the acquaintance of every European people. They had now
seen the boundaries of the Old World broken through, and
sailed forth to explore the New. They had rounded the
Cape in the wake of the Portuguese; their argosies had
touched at the port of Goa, and trafficked in the Persian
Gulf. They had sailed with the Spaniards to Peru and
Mexico; they had marvelled with the followers of Cortes
at the temple-pyramids of the Aztecs, and plucked roses
in the gardens of Yucay. Nearer home, their imagination
had been kindled by the overthrow of an empire which
Julius had founded. They were surveying from their
very walls the tragedy of nations, and their streets were
thronged with discrowned sovereigns. The most beautiful
creations of the Hellenic muse had sprung Aphroditè-like
from the spray of the self-same sea that sparkled
in the havens of Ragusa.</p>

<p>Living in this poetic world, one can hardly wonder
that Ragusa caught the inspiration of her surroundings;
that she ‘awoke to ecstasy the living lyre,’ in the tones<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420"></a>[420]</span>
of her mother-tongue; that, surveying the catastrophe of
the Serbian race, she created a Serbian drama. From
the commencement of the last quarter of the fifteenth
century onwards, Ragusa produces a long succession of
poets and dramatists,<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> who are great and valuable almost
in proportion as they are unknown to the West. For
their pre-eminent value lies in their having composed
in a Sclavonic tongue. Amongst the most celebrated
works of Ragusan poets may be mentioned the ‘Dervishiade’
of Stephen Gozze, a comic epos; the ‘Jegyupka’
or gipsy-woman, a satiric poem by Andreas Giubronović;
and the lyrics of Dominico Zlatarić, also known
as a painter, and as translator of Tasso and of some plays
of Sophocles. Nor was Ragusa wanting in poetesses to
rival her poets; the epigrams of Floria Zuzzeri, who
wrote in Italian as well as Sclavonic, are still of renown.
But the most celebrated names in the long annals of Ragusan
literature are those of Junius Palmotta and Giovanni
Gondola.<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> It is a high merit of Palmotta’s dramas
that the subjects are taken from the history of Southern-Sclaves.<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a>
The master-work of Gondola is the ‘Osmanide,’
an epic poem recording the prowess of Sultan Osman
against the Poles. This is a strange witness to the Turkish
sympathies of the Republic, and the noblest monument of
Ragusan genius. The poems of Gondola are still, among
all South-Sclavonic peoples, ‘familiar in their mouths as
household words;’ and though Ragusa has lost her
wealth and liberty, her most golden memories live still
in the bard—</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Ragusa also produced Latin poets, and a race of
historians, among whom may be mentioned Cervario
Tuberone, Nicolas Ragnina, and, greatest of all, Anselmo
Banduri, whose name is of European renown. The
breadth of the Ragusan genius is illustrated by the fact
that her additions to the exact sciences are as splendid as
the works of her imagination. Her citizens Gazoli, Antonius
Medus, Ghetaldi, and at a later period Boscović,
rank among the patriarchs of astronomy and mathematics.
Marino Ghetaldi, born at Ragusa in 1566, anticipated
Descartes in the application of algebra to geometry, and
lays a claim to the invention of the telescope. Amongst
other feats he tested the experiment of Archimedes, and
is said to have consumed a boat with his burning-glass.
On the shore of a bay to the south of Ragusa is still
pointed out the fern-valanced cavern where Ghetaldi
loved to pursue his discoveries; and such was the impression
wrought by the man of science on the popular
mind, that to this day the sailor, as he passes the mouth
of Ghetaldi’s cave, invokes St. Blasius to frustrate the
incantations of the magician.</p>

<p>The literary and commercial bloom of Ragusa continued
to the middle of the seventeenth century, little
abated by a plague, which in 1526 destroyed twenty
thousand of the population in six months; or by the loss<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422"></a>[422]</span>
of many ships in the Spanish service. But Ragusa had
already received warnings of a more tremendous catastrophe,
such as had befallen her Roman ancestress
Epidaurus. In 1520, 1521, 1536, and 1639, the city
had suffered from shocks of earthquake.</p>

<p>It was half-past eight o’clock on the morning of
April the 6th, the Wednesday in Holy Week, 1667. The
Maggior Consiglio was about to hold a session, for
the purpose of according grace to delinquents, and the
Rector of the Republic, Simeon Ghetaldi, and some of
the councillors, were already preparing to take their
places. The inhabitants of Ragusa were mostly at home,
or in the churches at morning prayer, when, without
a moment’s warning, a tremendous shock of earthquake
overwhelmed the whole city and entombed a fifth
of the population in the ruins. The Rector of the Republic,
five-sixths of the nobles, nine-tenths of the clergy, a
Dutch ambassador with his suite of thirty, then on his way
to Constantinople, and six thousand citizens, were buried.
Marble palaces—the accumulated embellishments of ages
of prosperity—valuable libraries, archives, irreplaceable
manuscripts—all alike perished. The sea left the harbour
dry four times, and rising to a mountainous height, four
times threatened to engulf the land. The ships in the
port were sucked into the vortex of the deep, or dashed to
pieces against each other or the rocks. The wells were
dried up. Huge cliffs were split from top to bottom. The
sky was darkened by a dense cloud of sand. The
earthquake was succeeded by a fire, and a strong gale
springing up spread the flames over every quarter of
the ruins. Finally, to complete the catastrophe, the wild
Morlachs descended from the mountains and pillaged
what remained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423"></a>[423]</span></p>

<p>Ragusa never recovered from the blow. Her commerce
was for long reduced to the coast-traffic of small <i>trabaccoli</i>.
Her literature, indeed, partly revived; and during the
early years of the French war the neutrality of Ragusa
secured for her once more much of the Mediterranean
carrying trade, and by the end of the last century her
population amounted to 15,000. But, in 1806, Napoleon
seized Ragusa, and two years later an adjutant of General
Marmont announced that the Republic of Ragusa had
ceased to exist. It yet remained for the diplomatists of
the Allied Powers to consummate in cold blood what
Buonaparte had perpetrated in the frenzy of his ambition;
and at the Congress of Vienna an English plenipotentiary
set his signature to a document by which the ancient
Republic was handed over to what was then the most
brutal and despotic government in Europe. Since that
date Ragusa has been the head town of a ‘circle,’ and the
stately palace of her Rectors has sunk into the ‘<i>bureau</i>’
of an Austrian ‘<i>Kreis-chef</i>!’</p>

<p>And yet how fascinating is Ragusa still! It far surpassed
our most sanguine expectations. We entered the
once sovereign city by the Porta Pille, one of two gates
which form the north and south poles of the little town,
and are the only public openings in the circuit of its
massive walls. From a niche above this portal the old
saviour of the Republic, St. Blasius, looked down upon
us benignantly, with finger raised aloft in the act of benediction;
and the same figure of his saintship occurs at intervals
all round the walls, which have been likened to a
girdle of amulets. The Porta Pille passed, we found ourselves
in the <i>Stradone</i> or <i>Corso</i>, the main street of Ragusa,
and the finest and widest in Dalmatia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424"></a>[424]</span></p>

<p>From the student of Ragusan history this street claims
a peculiar interest. Originally it was nothing else than a
narrow channel of sea—the ‘silver streak’ that moated
off the Roman rock asylum of Lavve from the more
rustic dwellings of Serbian Dubrovnik, scattered among
the pine-trees on the rocky steep of the adjoining mainland.
But in the thirteenth century, when the antagonism
between Serb and Roman had already ceased, and the
Serbian language had become the mother-tongue of the
descendants of the Epidauritan refugees, the channel was
filled in and the site levelled to make room for an airy
piazza,<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> where, in the succeeding age, stately palaces of
four or five storeys rose on either side, and rivalled those
of Venice in their magnificence. Thus what had originally
been a barrier between two hostile nationalities, has since
become a bond of union, as the favourite meeting place
and social promenade for all classes of Ragusan citizens.
The lofty palaces of the original Piazza were overwhelmed
by the great earthquake, and their loftiness made them terribly
destructive of life, so that when the Senate rebuilt
this part of the city the height of the new houses was
limited to two, or at most three, storeys. The Piazza
itself shrank into the present Stradone, in sympathy with
the straitened circumstances of New Ragusa; but, shadow
as it is of its former majesty, it still forms a noble
thoroughfare.</p>

<p>Every building on either side, as indeed throughout
the town, is of fine stone, and the street—like all other
streets of Ragusa—is paved with large deftly squared
slabs, which take the polish of marble, and caused us to
slip more than once. Immediately on entering we passed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_425"></a>[425]</span>
on the right a fifteenth-century cistern<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> decorated with
quaint heads of dragons; it is from this that Ragusa
derives her water supply, brought hither by a conduit
from a mountain source fifteen miles off. Opposite is
the <i>Chiesa del Redentore</i>, in classic Venetian style, the
elaborate carvings of its façade thrown into exquisite
reliefs by the golden colours of the stone; and above
its portal an inscription recording the building of the
church (legend says that the matrons of Ragusa brought
hither the material) after the earthquake of 1536—<i>ad
avertendam cœlestem iram in maximo terræ tremore</i>.
Alas! it averted not a greater ruin, though by some
strange irony of fortune it survived the earthquake of
1667, to stand a monument of disregarded piety. Next
is the Franciscan convent in several tastes, and then, on
either side of the road, a vista of solid stone houses, built
with great regularity in a plain but dignified style, with
classic cornices.</p>

<p>A five minutes’ walk—such a little place is this!—brought
us to the other end of the city, the street terminating
abruptly in the Porta Plocce, the sea-gate, and
otherwise the south-pole of Ragusa. But just before
reaching this, the Stradone opens on the right on to a
small Piazza, where the most beautiful and interesting
edifices in Ragusa are congregated.</p>

<p>Everywhere around is something which takes us back
to the most glorious days of the Republic. Opposite is a
living monument of that mechanical genius which shines
in the great works of Ghetaldi and Boscović. This is
the Torre del Orologio, with a domical cupola containing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426"></a>[426]</span>
a wonderful clock, in which a revolving globe shows the
moon’s age, and two bronze figures of men in armour
strike a bell to tell the hours. Upon the bell are the
Latin lines:—</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>To the left is a beautiful Moresco-Gothic building,
the Dogana and Zecca or Mint of the Republic—at present
serving as the <i>Ricevitoria principale</i> of the Emperor and
King. From here issued forth those half Byzantine pieces
with their saintly Blasius and ‘<i>Tuta Salus</i>’ scroll, of which
we had seen so many examples on the former sites of Ragusan
industry in Bosnia. The Mint, which is behind the
Dogana, I visited in company with Signor Vincenzo Adamović,
who is one of the representatives of numismatics
in modern Ragusa, and who, besides possessing a considerable
collection, has published some interesting essays
on the medallic history of the Republic. The coins of
Ragusa date back, according to Signor Adamović, at least
to the ninth century. The earliest coin is of brass, bearing
the Byzantine name ‘<i>Follaris</i>’ or ‘<i>Obolus</i>,’ and displaying
on the obverse a laureated head, evidently, like
some of our Anglo-Saxon monetary effigies of the same
date, copied from the fourth-century coinage of the Roman
Empire. The earliest silver coin, the <i>Grosso</i> or <i>Denaro</i>,
dates from the end of the thirteenth century,<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> and is the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427"></a>[427]</span>
first coin on which St. Blasius makes his appearance.
The Mint is at present converted into a granary for oats,
so that there is little to remark inside the building except
an inscription over the massive arch of the standard
office of weights and measures:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">Pondero dum merces, ponderat ipse Deus.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The present Zecca and Dogana were built in the year
1520, and are among the few buildings which by their
massive construction withstood the shock of the great
earthquake of 1667. But there is another building
hard by, of greater antiquity and more absorbing interest,
which has also happily come down to us uninjured.
The Palazzo Rettorale, the residence of the old Rectors
of the Republic, whose rich colonnade faces the Piazzetta
on the left, is a monumental epitome of Ragusan history—the
grandest relic of the ancient commonwealth. An
inscription on the exterior records that it was founded
in 1435 ‘by the nobles and most prudent citizens of
Ragusa, under the divine auspices of Blasius, martyr
and most holy priest, being patron of this city of Epidaura
Ragusa.’<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a> The date of its completion, 1452,
takes us back to the period when the commerce and
literature of Ragusa were first bursting into bloom. The
style of the architecture, Florentine, and not Venetian, is
typical of the Tuscan source whence Ragusan literature<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428"></a>[428]</span>
drew its earliest inspiration, and bids a kind of architectural
defiance to the Lion of St. Mark. This is not so
huge a pile as the palace of the Doges, but neither has it
that element of barbaresqueness. These massive arches
and the backbone of iron girders within, which enabled
the building to withstand the terrific ordeal of the earthquake,
characterise well the sober sense and heroic endurance
of the citizens who reared it.</p>

<p>This is the <i>Lararium</i> of the Republic. Within are
the effigies of her greatest heroes and benefactors, the
archives of her history,<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> the rolls of her nobility. This
is a treasure-house of the associations of every age of
Ragusan story. The stone benches in the porch beneath
the spacious arcade are the same on which the senators
and patricians of old used to discuss the gravest affairs of
state. The massiveness of the Roman arches and that
classic colonnade may well be taken to betray the spirit
of that race to which the ancient rock of asylum owed
her first foundations; the too imaginative patriotism of
Ragusa has even gone farther, and claims the capitals
themselves to have been transported hither from the
Epidauritan mother-city. On one of these is carved an
alchemist, seated book in hand amidst his crucibles and
alembics, and a Latin inscription<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> of apparently the same
date as the sculpture, informs the spectator that he is viewing
the inventor of medical arts—Æsculapius, ‘the glory
of his birth-place, Ragusa.’ At least it records the pious
devotion of mediæval Ragusa to her Roman <i>penates</i>; and
though the Cupids that sport amidst the acanthus-leaves
of the other capitals were certainly never carved at Epidaurus,
we may yet see in them an interesting tribute of
Ragusa to the beautiful paganism of the Renascence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_429"></a>[429]</span></p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_430"></a>[430]</span></p>

<p>In a corner of the fine columniated court within the
palace lies the monument of Orlando, whose exploits in
slaying the Saracen Emir have been already recorded.
Near it stood of old the banner of the second saviour of
the Republic—San Biagio. In the middle of the court
is a patinated bronze bust of a man with peaked beard
and somewhat careworn expression, and, on the pedestal,
the inscription ‘Michaeli Prazzato benemerito
Civi ex S.C. <span class="allsmcap">MDCXXXVIII</span>.’ Michael Prazzato was a well-deserving
citizen indeed! He left no less than 200,000
Genoese doubloons to the Republic—a sum equivalent to
600,000<i>l.</i> of our money—but the actual equivalent of
which in the present day would have to be reckoned in
millions. Such were the merchant princes of Ragusa!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431"></a>[431]</span>
But the monument, curiously enough, recorded the catastrophe
as well as the prosperity of the city. On the back
of the pedestal was a further inscription commemorating
the overthrow of the bust by ‘the great earthquake,’
and its setting up anew. The head had been seriously
caved in behind.</p>

<p>In the ‘Mother Church’ of the neighbouring, formerly
Ragusan, island of Mezzo, is another memorial of Michele
Prazzato, a napkin which once belonged to Charles V.
At a time when Spain was desolated by a famine, Prazzato
earned the gratitude of her sovereign by transporting
there large cargoes of grain in his huge carracks. Hearing
of Prazzato’s presence, the Emperor called him in, it
is said, while he was shaving, and offered him a large sum
of money,—titles, and office under his government. ‘Sire,’
replied our merchant prince, ‘if I am satiated with riches
it is that I never took them as a gift; if I am king on
board my carracks, it is that I never sought for honours;
if I am a free citizen of my fatherland, Ragusa, it is that
I have never sought for titles. As a remembrance of
your sovereign favour, grant me rather this napkin.’<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a>
Charles V., struck at such greatness of soul, took what
was asked for from beneath his beard and handed it to
Prazzato.</p>

<p>But walled into a doorway at the side of Prazzato’s
monument is another inscription recording patriotic
devotion of a still higher order. Nicola Bunić<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a> has
well deserved the title of the Ragusan Regulus. It was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_432"></a>[432]</span>
after the great calamity of 1667, when Ragusa was
beginning a new start in life, that Kara Mustapha,
intent on strangling her new birth, sent in a monstrous
claim for 146,000 dollars. The senate and citizens of
Ragusa, who knew the personal animosity of Mustapha
against the Republic, were in despair. At this critical
juncture two citizens, who had already rendered themselves
eminent by their efforts in remedying the effects
of the earthquake and in repulsing the Morlach incursions,
volunteered to risk their lives in averting
the storm. One was Marino Caboga<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> and the other
Nicola Bunić. On their arrival the Grand Vizier attempted
to extract from them a treaty surrendering
Ragusa to the Turk. They refused, and were thrown
into noisome dungeons. Caboga, after languishing several
years in captivity, was enabled to return to Ragusa and
receive the acclamations of his fellow-citizens. This slab
was the only homage which the Republic could offer to
Bunić. The inscription, Englished, is as follows:—‘To
Nicola Bunić, a Senator of singular discreetness, who, in
the most perilous times of the Commonwealth, undertook
of his own accord a most perilous embassy to the neighbouring
Pashà of Bosnia, and being sent on by him by
way of Silistria to the Turkish Sultan, there, after long
imprisonment, died in chains for the liberty of his country,
and who by his death and constancy of soul hath earned
an immortal name through all posterity; to the honour
and memory of whom this monument is by decree of the
Senate set up, in the year 1678.’<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_433"></a>[433]</span></p>

<p>Near the Palazzo Rettorale rises the Duomo of St.
Mary—but alas! except the foundations on which the
present building rests, not one stone has been left upon
another of Cœur-de-Lion’s original cathedral. In the
present eighteenth-century Italian edifice there is little to
arrest the attention; but the Reliquiario<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> is wonderful!
When Ragusan commerce was at its acmè, ‘the merchants
of the Republic,’ we read, ‘collected the precious relics
of the saints from all parts of Thrace, Bulgaria, Bosnia,
Albania, and Greece, where they had business, following
the promptings of their piety; sometimes at their own
expense, sometimes at the expense of the Republic, rescuing
them from barbarism and ignorance.’ Hither, too,
when the Infidel overran the South-Sclavonic lands, pious
votaries carried for safety what was more precious to
them than worldly goods or life itself. Here, in the City
of Refuge, are gathered together the penates of the Serbian
people. Among the most interesting of these national
relics was the silver cross of Czar Dūshan, which is double,
like the Hungarian. It is set in front with crystals, and
covered with volute filigree work; at the back with vine
ornaments. As to St. Blasius, there seemed enough relics
of the patron saint of the Republic to make several originals,
if pieced together! An Oriental crown enclosing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_434"></a>[434]</span>
a piece of his cranium, brought hither from the East in
the eleventh century, is a master-piece of Byzantine art.
Then there is a very choice fragment of John the Baptist’s
arm, which was added to the collection in 1452;
under, to say the least of it, remarkable circumstances.
The Ragusans had taken care of it for a sick Bosniac, who
had promised his precious relic to the Florentines. The
Bosniac recovered his health; but, as neither Papal
thunders nor Tuscan threats availed him to recover the
smallest fraction of St. John the Baptist, he turned for
help to Bajazet. Bajazet referred the matter to one of
his Pashàs, and the Turk, no doubt richly bribed by
the Ragusans, cut the matter short by observing to the
claimant that if he was in want of Christian bones he
might pick up plenty on the field of Kóssovo!</p>

<p>Although as Englishmen we could get up no particular
enthusiasm for St. Blaze’s collar bones, the cases were
magnificent, and the ancient filigree work of Ragusa particularly
struck us. In general appearance the later specimens
of the Ragusan silversmith’s art resemble Maltese
work, and effloresce into the same flowers and foliage. But
the taste for the natural, which followed on the revived
study of antiquity, displays itself here still more conspicuously
in the development of a kind of silver Palissy-ware
by the hands of a great Ragusan master. The most wonderful
objects in the Reliquiario are a silver basin and ewer,
wrought in the fifteenth century by a Ragusan artist,
Giovanni Progonović,<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> in a style so original, that I doubt
if anything at all resembling it has even been attempted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435"></a>[435]</span>
elsewhere. These are covered with all kinds of shells,
creeping things, flowers, and foliage—elegant lizards, not
like those that the great potter moulded at his best, but
perfectly animate—such as the Neapolitan casts from the
living creature. Nay, more, the most perfect mechanism
is added to perfect art, and if water be poured into the
basin the little creatures move as if they were alive!
Everything is enamelled of its natural colour, and
though now somewhat diminished in brightness, you
have actually to touch the plants and animals to realize
that they are not real lizards or fern-leaves preserved
in some way. In the vase is a nosegay of silver grasses,
each delicate thread, each minutest seed, perfectly reproduced
and coloured; among them I recognised a beautiful
three-spiked grass that I had noticed growing in the neighbourhood
of Ragusa—so true, so indigenous, is this art!</p>

<p>The kindness of Signor Adamović enabled me to see
the Reliquiario of the Dominican monastery here. Chief
amongst the relics was the silver cross of another Serbian
monarch, Stephen Uroš, son of his greater namesake and
father of Czar Dūshan, with remains of angular ornamentation,
and the following inscription:—<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">‘<i>Isus Hristos Nika.</i>’</p>

<p>‘<i>This venerable cross was made by the Lord King Stephen Uroš,
for the church of the Holy Apostles Peter and Paul: that it may be unto
him for a safeguard and for remission of sins. And the bishop of
Rascia, Gregory II., made this venerable cross in like manner as that
widow who gave her two mites. Whosoever shall presume to carry off
this cross, let him be accursed of the holy Apostles and of the venerable
wood. Of this Cross am I defended; I oppose myself to demons,
fearing neither their toils nor their deceits, even as the proud was made
foolish and crushed beneath the force of Christ crucified.</i>’</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_436"></a>[436]</span></p>

<p>Such is superstition!</p>

<p>There were also many early specimens of filigree
work with floral tendencies, and a head—I dare not call
it unique—of St. Stephen of Hungary. There was one
arm the attribution of which was unknown to the monks,
but having succeeded in deciphering a mediæval inscription
at the base, I was pleased to be able to inform them
that they were the happy possessors of St. Luke’s arm!
In the Dominican church and adjoining chapels are
many interesting monument of Ragusan citizens, amongst
others the tomb of Ghetaldi. There are many family
vaults of the Ragusan nobles with <i>Jure hereditario</i>
inscribed on them; but one slab inscribed in Italian as
‘the Common Sepulchre of the Confraternity of the Carpenters,’
was peculiarly interesting as a memorial of the
guild-brotherhoods of the old Artigiani, which formed
such a prominent feature in the early history of the commonwealth.</p>

<p>One may spend days in wandering about Ragusa—exploring
her streets, her churches and monasteries, her
palaces, and the private houses of her citizens—and always
lighting on some interesting memorial of the past. In
the meanest houses, in the old walls, in the pavement
beneath your feet, you stumble against fragments of sculptured
marble—waifs from the wreck of Ragusa as she
existed before the earthquake. Of the clean sweep
wrought by that terrible calamity, the streets themselves,
laid out at right angles, are an eloquent witness; and yet
it is surprising how many vestiges of the mediæval city
are still to be traced. Not one of the narrow side streets
but has its sculptured doorways and mouldings—its ogee
window-arches, and luxuriant, half classical, half Gothic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437"></a>[437]</span>
foliage. Here and there you pass one of the palaces of the
old nobility—the <i>Case Signorili</i>, as they are called—with
the family scutcheon carved over the portal, and dignified
projecting balconies. So marvellous is this climate that
the most beautiful garden and hothouse flowers grow
wherever there is a chink in an old wall. In the narrowest
alleys the stately shadows of bygone magnificence
are lighted up by hanging gardens of scarlet geraniums,
golden zinnias, balsams, and fragrant carnations clinging
to the crevices of ancient palaces and houses, while here
and there a vine-spray joins the opposite sides of the
street.</p>

<p>On the landside of the <i>Stradone</i> or high-street the city
extends in terraces on the lower flank of the limestone
mountain which dominates it. The streets here are prolonged
flights of steps, of the usual slippery marble, up
which we made our way with difficulty, to obtain a bird’s-eye
view of the city from the upper wall. The view was
well worth the pains. The whole of Ragusa lay below
us, circled on three sides by a sapphire ring of sea. To
the north was the fine rock of Fort Lorenzo, whose
very foundations saved the infant Commonwealth from
the Venetians, and, beneath it, the narrow cove of
sea which almost threatens to cut off the land gate of
the city. To the south opened the old port of Ragusa,
the haven of the Argosies; beyond, rose the gardens
and convent of the isle of Lacroma, where Cœur-de-Lion
landed, and from whose western precipices malefactors
were cast headlong into the sea in the days of the
Republic. The colours were simply marvellous—the
roofs, the walls, the domes, the campaniles, of the city
below, took the rose and orange hues of a ripe apricot;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_438"></a>[438]</span>
the sea beyond was of the most wondrous ultramarine—and
Ragusa with her lofty Oriental walls, rose from its
now tranquil bosom like Jerusalem the golden from
some crystal sea above. But it is the smallness of Ragusa
that strikes one almost more than anything. It seems almost
impossible to realize that this little town below should
have maintained its independence for centuries amidst
surrounding empires; that the wealth of what is now
Turkey-in-Europe was once hoarded beneath these
closely huddled roofs; that the mightiest carracks of the
Spanish navy sailed forth from this petty haven. Ragusa
looks the mere plaything of the ocean; and indeed they
say that in storms the sea surges up these narrow gorges,
and flings its spray right over the cliff-set walls on to the
house-tops within, frosting roofs and windows with crystalline
brine.</p>

<p>Ragusa is still, as ever, a city of asylum. At the
present moment a number of houseless Christian refugees
from the Herzegovina have sought shelter here. A colony
of these is domiciled outside the Porta Plocce, or sea-gate,
in some stable-like buildings which once served as
the Lazaretto. On our way there we passed the Turkish
market, where a number of Turks were purchasing salt,
corn, and fodder for the starving troops of the Sultan in
the revolted districts.</p>

<p>The condition in which we found the refugees did
great credit to the hospitality of the Ragusans.<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> We had
expected to find a set of half-starved miserable wretches,
clad in rags and worn with anxiety for absent fathers,
husbands, sons. Quite the contrary! They were well<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_439"></a>[439]</span>
fed; they did not seem at all forlorn, and with their light
white kerchiefs and chemises they presented a picture of
cleanliness which would have put to shame the squalor of
many an Italian-Dalmatian. Among the Bosnian refugees
of the Save-lands were to be seen many able-bodied men.
Here it was far otherwise. The Herzegovinians are made
of sterner stuff, and we noticed among the refugees no
boys over thirteen, and no men, except one cripple, under
seventy, and there were few enough even of these. The
women, too, showed something of the spirit of the matrons
of old. They had sold their silver trinkets to buy arms
for their husbands. Most of them were already stripped
of the coins with which they love to bespangle their fez—of
the silver brooches of their belt, shaped like two
convolvulus leaves—of the broad girdle studded like
an ephod with rudely cut carnelians, agates, amethysts,
and roots-of-emerald, set like the mediæval gems in the
neighbouring Reliquiario. One woman who still possessed
this superb <i>ceinture</i> offered it me for twenty gulden—rather
less than two pounds. The gems came, she told
us, from the Herzegovinian valleys about Nevešinje—she
did not know that the agates and carnelians of these prolific
sites were exported of old to the sea-ports of Roman
Dalmatia, there to be set, as now, in rings and trinkets,
and carved with classical devices!<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> Attire so neat and
graceful needed not, however, the embellishment of barbaric
jewellery; the bright crimson fez, the light white
kerchief drawn over it and falling about the shoulders in
artistic folds, the dark indigo jacket harmonising with
the deep reds and oranges of the apron—these were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_440"></a>[440]</span>
amply sufficient to make the little groups highly picturesque
as they sat or leant before their new homes, plying
their spindles most industriously. Little children were
playing before the women—such frank pleasant faces!—many
with hair as fair as ever that of young Angles.</p>

<p>There were about sixty families on this spot, as we
found out on distributing a small largess of ten kreutzers
a family; and there is another colony of fugitives at
Gravosa. The Austrian Government allows each family
on an average twenty kreutzers a day, and the commune
of Ragusa makes up the amount to thirty-six kreutzers—not
more than eightpence of our money, but sufficient to
support life out here. To-day (September 3) there is a
three days’ truce between the Turks and the insurgents,
and a proclamation has been issued by the Turkish
governor of the Herzegovina, in which the Pashà promises
full indemnity and freedom from molestation to
any of the refugees who may consent during this period
to return home. Very few, however, have accepted the
kind invitation, and for one very good reason—that they
have no homes left them to return to.</p>

<p>We were very anxious to secure some memorial of
the fugitives; so bringing down the photographer of Ragusa
to their colony, we induced the Herzegovinians, by
promises of largess, to form a series of groups. As may
be easily imagined, there was great difficulty in getting
them to keep quiet. The children kept moving about,
the women always wanted to set their caps a little differently
at the last moment, and one gentleman was very
particular about the posture of his wooden leg. However,
we succeeded at last, and for a glimpse at the Herzegovinian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441"></a>[441]</span>
refugees, as we saw them at Ragusa, I can refer the reader
to the <a href="#fp1">frontispiece</a> of this work.</p>

<p>The turbaned figure to the right of the illustration,
and the elegant damsel with whom he is walking arm in
arm, are not refugees, but peasants from the immediate
neighbourhood of Ragusa. The man’s costume, so closely
approaching the Turkish, is an interesting example of the
influence wrought by the peculiar relations in which, of
old, Ragusa stood to the Turks.<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> Nowhere else in Dalmatia
does the costume of the peasant so nearly approach
that of the true-believer. Here we have not only the
same jacket and vest with their gorgeous gold embroidery,
the same sash and schalvars, but even a turban on the
head; and were it not for his white stockings and a
certain preference for crimson jackets, the Ragusan
peasant might easily be mistaken for a Moslem. This
habit of dress is not confined to the peasants; it is
still to be seen among the servants and lower classes in
Ragusa itself, and was doubtless originally adopted by
the Ragusan merchants to avoid raising the susceptibilities
of the infidels with whom they traded, by appearing in
the garb of a Giaour. In the seventeenth century, as may
be gathered from the relation of an English traveller, the
Ragusan merchant who travelled in Turkey in European
costume did so at his peril. Blunt, who voyaged himself
‘clad in Turkish manner,’ tells us,<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> in his quaint style,
how ‘foure Spahy-Timariots’ met his caravan, ‘where was
a Ragusean, a Merchant of quality, who came in at <i>Spalatra</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442"></a>[442]</span>
to goe for Constantinople, he being clothed in the Italian
fashion and spruce, they justled him: He not yet considering
how the place had changed his condition, stood
upon his <i>termes</i>, till they with their Axes, and iron Maces
(the weapon of that <i>country</i>) broke two of his ribs, in
which case, we left him behinde, halfe dead, either to
get backe as he could, or be devoured of beasts.’</p>

<p>‘If I appeared,’ says Blunt a little farther on, ‘in the
least part clothed like a Christian, I was tufted like an
Owle among other birds.’</p>

<p>Be pleased to observe the elegant pose of the Ragusan
damsel who has condescended to visit these unfortunates
arm in arm with our turbaned signior! There is a marked
contrast between these refined peasant gentle-folk—these
‘<i>Nostrani</i>,’ as the Ragusans call all those who dwell
within the limits of the old Republic—and yonder ‘<i>Morlacchi</i>’—the
ruder sons and daughters of the Herzegovinian
mountains. Ragusa, even in her days of mourning, has
inherited something of her former civilization; a peculiar
refinement, both in her peasants and citizens, not to be met
with anywhere else throughout these lands, must strike
the most unobservant traveller. Not here the rude stare,
the pestering beggary, the meanness and mendacity—the
painful relics of that barbarous Venetian policy which
condemned Dalmatia to perpetual poverty and ignorance.
The lion of St. Mark has never weighed like an incubus
on Ragusa. It needs to have visited Spalato and other
Dalmatian cities to appreciate the extraordinary exception
in favour of cleanliness and good manners that
presents itself here.</p>

<p>The language here, not counting the German spoken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_443"></a>[443]</span>
by the Austrian soldiery, is partly Italian and partly
Sclavonic, but the bulk of the population speak only Sclavonic.
Here you hear the Serbian language at its best;
it, too, seems to have felt the influence of the literary
Italian which was once the official and scholastic language
of the Republic, and falls from the lips of Ragusan citizens
with Tuscan elegance and softness. The two elements
of which Dubrovnik-Ragusa was originally composed, the
Serbian and the Roman, blend to form the typical Ragusan
features—now and again separating themselves
in all their individuality. In the streets of Ragusa
the turquoise eyes of the true Sclave peep out often
enough from beneath the raven locks and lashes of the
Italian.</p>

<p>Is the time, one asks oneself, to arrive once more when
Ragusa shall take up anew the work for which by her very
birth she is so eminently fitted—will she once more take
her place as the pioneer of South-Sclavonic literature
and civilisation? Her ‘gift of tongues,’ her sober industry,
her position, still remain. Though the old haven of the
Argosies has become too small for the leviathans of
modern days, she has at hand in Gravosa the finest
harbour on the Dalmatian coast—the nearest port to
the point where the Narenta debouches on the sea after
cleaving a path through the Dinaric Alps towards the
Drina and the commercial basin of the Danube. The
old trade route of Ragusan merchants only waits for the
demolition of artificial barriers to be opened out anew.
Already we hear of the improvement of the navigation of
the lower Narenta, and a new steam service is planned
between Stagno and Ragusa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_444"></a>[444]</span></p>

<p>Ragusa is the natural port of the Illyrian interior—the
born interpreter between the Italian and Sclave.
Those only who have traversed the barbarous lands between
the Adriatic and the Save can adequately realise
how intimately the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina
is bound up with the future of Ragusa. The plodding
genius of the Serbs needs to be fanned into energy by
these fresh sea-breezes—their imagination languishes for
want of this southern sunshine!</p>

<p>Here at last, after groping among the primeval
shadows of the mighty beech and pinewoods of the Bosnian
midlands, we take our ease in one of the gorgeous
rock-girt coves which beautify the environs of Ragusa.
Overhead are hanging groves and gardens of rosy oleander,
ferny palms, myrtles, and creepers with flame-coloured
trumpets. On the steep, a spiry aloe leans forward, stretching
towards the south; beneath us the cliffs sink precipitously
into the blue-emerald waters—intensified in the
deeper pools into a vinous purple—stretching away to
the horizon in marvellous ultramarine—on either side of
the cove, fretting in a silvery line of foam against walls
of orange rock whose natural brilliance is glorified now
into refined gold by the setting sun. This is not the light
of common day!—it stands to it as some gorgeous mediæval
blazoning to a modern chromo-lithograph. It dazzles
our dull northern eyes. We are on the borders of
another world. We catch an inspiration of the South.
The waters of the next sea-bosom lap the ruins of Hellenic
Epidaurus.</p>

<p>But the gold on the rocks melts into more sombre
browns and greys; the western steeps of the cove lose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_445"></a>[445]</span>
their outlines in vague shadow; the intense azure of sea
and sky dies into a dark sapphire; the plashing of the
waves below asserts itself in tones more solemn with
the gathering twilight, and the darkness deepens into
night.</p>

the name of the <i>Carpathian</i> mountains, and the Carpi of Roman historians.
Hilferding points out that of the names of Chorvat’s four brothers,
as given by Constantine Porphyrogenitus, two are equivalent in meaning to
‘Delay’ or ‘Tarrying,’ and Chorvat’s two sisters bear the Sclavonic names
of ‘Joy’ and ‘Sorrow.’ The names are perhaps allegorical of the gradual

Pope Bogomil; but they seem to me not to allow sufficient weight to
Byzantine evidence. It is right, however, to note that ‘Bogomil’ is a possible
Bulgarian personal name, and exactly answers, as Jireček observes, to
the German ‘Gottlieb.’ It is remarkable that the heretics never called
themselves Bogomiles, but simply ‘Christians,’ as did the Patarenes and
Albigensians of the West. By the orthodox Sclaves they were called
Bogomiles, <i>Babuni</i>, <i>Manicheji</i>, and in Bosnia also <i>Patareni</i>, and, apparently
from a corrupted form of that word, <i>Potur</i>.</p>

According to Euthymius, who also bears witness to the Paternoster being
their only form, they prayed five times during the day and seven at night.
Euthymius (see also Epiphanius) says that they prayed also to demons to
avert evil, and that Basilius, their heresiarch, declared that in their gospels
was the text, ‘Worship demons, not that they may do good to you, but that
they may not do you harm.’ On this charge of devil-worship, however even
Cosmas is silent.</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_37" href="#FNanchor_37" class="label">[37]</a> This is illustrated by the missionary work of St. Sava in that century.
At the end of the ninth century the Narentines, living in the immediate
neighbourhood of Spalato and Ragusa, the two focuses of Roman Christianity,
were still unconverted, and their country, according to Constantine Porphyrogenitus,
was still known as Pagania. See <a href="#Page_367">p. 367</a>. How much more must

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_38" href="#FNanchor_38" class="label">[38]</a> I find that this explanation of the rapid advance of the Manichæan
heresy among the Sclaves has suggested itself, quite independently, to Herr
Jireček in his recent history. He says (<i>Gesch. der Bulgaren</i>, p. 175): ‘Es
war für Bogomil keine schwere Aufgabe, das unlängst erst dem Heidenthüme
entrückte Volk für eine Glaubenslehre zu gewinnen, welche, gleich
dem alten slawischen Mythus von den Bosi und Bêsi, lehrt, dass es zweierlei
höhere Wesen gebe, nämlich einen guten und einen bosen Gott.’ Herr Jireček,
however, seems to forget that Armenian missionaries were at work in Bulgaria
considerably before even the reputed date of Bogomil. If we remember
that at the time when Manichæism first sought a footing among the Bulgarians
a great part of the nation was still pagan, these considerations become
still more cogent.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_46" href="#FNanchor_46" class="label">[46]</a> As an example of the doctrinal identity of the Bogomilian and Albigensian
creeds, I may be allowed to recall a few main features of the heresy
about Toulouse as they struck the Roman Inquisitors in 1178. The heretics,
we are told, declared that there were two Principles: one Good Spirit, who
had created invisible things alone, and only those that were not susceptible of
change and corruption; the other Evil, who had created the sky, earth, man,
and all things visible. That the sacramental bread and wine were not transubstantiated
into the body and blood of Christ. That they rejected priests,
monks, bishops, and sacerdotalism generally. That churches were an abomination
to them. That the laying on of hands, and that, on adults, was the
only true baptism. As to marriage—‘virum cum uxore non posse salvari si
alter alteri debitum reddat.’ That beggars deserved no alms. That they
made use of the vernacular in their prayers: they were so ignorant of Latin
‘that they could not speak a couple of words.’ ‘It was necessary,’ says the
Cardinal of St. Chrysogonus, ‘to condescend to their ignorance, and to speak
of the sacraments of the Church, though this was sufficiently absurd, in the
vulgar tongue.’ Their preachers seem to have styled themselves, in the
figurative language common to the Bogomiles as well, ‘Angels of Light.’
The Abbot of Clairvaux states that one of them, doubtless in the same figurative
sense, called himself John the Baptist. This man, their chief
leader, was an aged man, who presided at the nocturnal prayer-meetings of
the sectaries, clad in a tunic or dalmatic. See <i>Roger of Hoveden’s Chronicle</i>,
(Prof. Stubbs’s edition, in the Rolls Series, vol. ii. p. 153, &amp;c.)</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_47" href="#FNanchor_47" class="label">[47]</a> Of the two divisions of the original Bulgarian Church, that of Dragoviče,
with its more uncompromising dualism, was followed in the West by
the Churches of Toulouse and Albano on the Lake of Garda. The other
Western Churches accepted the modified monotheism of what was known
as ‘The Bulgarian Church’ <i>par excellence</i>. This was in the thirteenth century.
At an earlier period, however, the absolute dualism of the Dragovician
Church had triumphed at the heretical Council of St. Felix de
Caraman, near Toulouse. See Jireček, op. cit. p. 213.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_48" href="#FNanchor_48" class="label">[48]</a> ‘Patarenes,’ the name by which the Bogomiles of Bosnia and other

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_49" href="#FNanchor_49" class="label">[49]</a> Jireček, loc. cit. The Armenian influence on Bulgaria and Bosnia, and
the Bogomilian influence on the West, is connected with the spread of a
curious heretical literature, derived from Oriental sources; of phantastic
Apocrypha and spurious Gospels, as well as of works of Oriental magic, which,
disseminated by the more corrupt adherents of the sect, entered into the
mediæval mythology of the West, and have still left their traces on its folklore
as well as on that of the Russians, Bulgarians, and Serbs. Jireček cites,
among other such works, the favourite Bulgarian legend of St. John Bogoslov,
containing a vision of the Dies iræ, which was brought from Bulgaria
in 1170 by Nazarius, bishop of the Upper Italian Patarenes, and translated
by him into Latin. Another such work is the account of the wanderings of
the Mother of God in hell; but perhaps the most interesting of all, and
one which in its origin seems to be almost purely Sclavonic, is the account—reflecting
the primitive Sclavonic custom of the ‘<i>Pobratimstvo</i>’—of how the
Sirmian Emperor, Probus, made Christ his sworn brother.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_50" href="#FNanchor_50" class="label">[50]</a> Radulphi de Coggeshale, <i>Chronicon Anglicanum</i> (in the Rolls Series,
p. 121, &amp;c.) The name ‘<i>Publicani</i>,’ by which the Essex chronicler alludes to
them, is a common name for the Bogomiles in the West, and is, of course, a
corruption of Pauliciani, or, perhaps, of a Sclavonic form of that word. The
heretics seem to have spread to England from Flanders, where they were
much oppressed by the Count. From the fragmentary details which Ralph
has given us, they seem to have preserved their Bogomilian faith in a very
pure form. They believed in the Two Principles and the evilness of matter,
rejected Purgatory, prayers for the dead, invocation of saints, infant baptism,
and accepted no scriptures but the Gospels and Canonical Epistles. Some went
so far as to charge them (as Euthymius had done long before) with praying
to Lucifer in their subterranean meeting-houses. They were ‘rusticani,’
and therefore not amenable to the argument of authority; by which, I suppose,
the preference of the early Protestants for the <i>vulgar tongue</i> is alluded
to. They observed a vegetable diet, and condemned marriage. From a
shameless relation of Gervase of Tilbury which Ralph reports, it appears
that there were holy women of the sect under vows of perpetual chastity.
Gervase himself, a clerk of the Archbishop of Rheims, coolly related to his
monkish friend, who chronicled the story with pleasing gusto, how, having
failed to seduce a beautiful country girl, he perceived her heresy, accused her
successfully of being a ‘Publican’ before the Inquisition, and feasted his
eyes with her dying agonies at the stake. Girl though she was, she died
without a groan, ‘instar,’ as even the monk cannot refrain from adding,
‘martyrum Christi (sed dissimili causa) qui olim pro Christiana religione a
paganis trucidabantur.’ The tragedy, even as told by Ralph, is of an intense
pathos, and deserves immortalising. How beautiful is that innocence
and how unutterable the villainy which provokes an under-current of
humanity even in a monkish narrator! After relations like this, the conduct
of Henry II. to the Oxford ‘Publicans’ will appear almost merciful: he
merely gave orders that they should be branded on the forehead with a red-hot
key and thrust forth from the city, and that nobody should give them
food or shelter. The notices of the Publicani, Albigenses, and other Bogomilian
sects who gained a footing in England, both by way of Flanders and
Guienne, never seem to have attracted the attention they deserve from
English historians. Yet the hatred born by the orthodox against these Bulgarian
intruders has added a word of reproach to the language.</p>

and ‘persecutor of that true son of the Church,’ his brother, Stephen
Wuk. In 1370 the Pope writes to the bishops of Ragusa, Spalato, and
‘Dirrhachio’ to put the Patarenes under ban. In 1372, from a letter of Pope
Gregory XI. to the Vicar of the Minorites in Bosnia, we learn that, in
view of the continuance of the heresy in Bosnia, Rascia, ‘Bassarat,’ and the
neighbouring regions, he granted them many privileges of building religious
houses in those countries; ‘Bourich, belonging to the noble Nicolas de Altomanich’

<p><a id="Footnote_74" href="#FNanchor_74" class="label">[74]</a> I have already noticed the early branching off of a Bogomilian church

passage in Raphael of Volaterra, who appears to have written his <i>Geographia</i>
towards the end of the fifteenth century. He says (<i>Geog.</i> p. 244, ed. Lyons,
1599), ‘In Bosnia, Rascia, and Serbia the sect of the Manichees is still followed.
They say there are two <i>Principia Rerum</i>—one good, one evil.
Nor do they acknowledge the Roman Pope, nor Christ “<i>Omousion</i>.” They
have monasteries (cœnobia) in hidden mountain valleys, where go matrons
who have escaped from certain diseases.’ These matrons say that for a certain
period they act as menials to holy men in accordance with a vow: ‘Atque
ita inter monachos mixtæ una vivunt; quæ quidem labes adhuc durat.’</p>

</div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_76" href="#FNanchor_76" class="label">[76]</a> Besides the evidence on this point which I have gathered from other
sources, I may notice a most interesting allusion to the Bogomiles or Patarenes
who had turned renegades, and a direct testimony that they went over
wholesale to Islâm, in J. Bapt. Montalbano, <i>Rerum Turcarum Commentarius</i>,
written certainly before the year 1630 (when it was published in the Elzevir
<i>Turci Imperii Status</i>). After mentioning the Catholic inhabitants, the writer
goes on to say, ‘Est aliud eo in regno (sc. Bosnæ) hominum genus <i>Potur</i>
appellatum, qui neque Christiani sunt, neque Turcæ, circumciduntur tamen,
pessimique habentur.’ ‘Potur’ is evidently a Sclavonised form of Patarene.
The writer goes on to say of these ‘Poturs’ that they, ‘to the number of
many thousand,’ offered to renegade from the Christian faith to that of Mahomet
if Sultan Soliman would grant them indemnity, and release them
from tribute. Soliman, says the writer (a Bolognese Doctor), thereupon
doubled their tribute, and enrolled their children among the Janissaries,
and ‘hence they are despised by both Turks and Christians.’ But this
whole account evidently bears witness to the wholesale renegation of the
Bogomiles. Further on the same writer, who had visited the country, bears
witness to the continuance of Protestantism in Turkish Bosnia in the sixteenth
century. ‘Eos inter,’ says he, of the inhabitants, ‘Calvinistæ Arrianique
multi.’</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_77" href="#FNanchor_77" class="label">[77]</a> I am indebted for this fact to Mr. W. J. Stillman, the excellent correspondent
of the <i>Times</i> in the Herzegovina, who gives an account of these refugees
in a letter from Ragusa dated Oct. 19, 1875, which I may be allowed to quote
as illustrating the more recent sufferings of this interesting sect, and the sad
case of the Christian refugees of Bosnia and the Herzegovina generally. ‘The
people of Popovo were tranquilly engaged in their fields and houses, when
the troops—Regulars and Bashi-Bazouks—came up; the latter killed the first
they came upon where they found them (one of them, the brother of a
villager who had appealed successfully to the Pashà at Trebinje against the
extortions of the Agas some months ago, being cut to pieces alive), and
all the rest fled in panic. The good <i>curé</i> of Ossonich is doing all he can for
them; but there are only eighty-five houses in this village, and he has 2,125
souls of the Popovites on his register for succour. Of these 300 were out on
the mountain-side on the night of the worst storm we have had this season.
One woman with a new-born babe was so exhausted in her flight that she
went to sleep, sitting on a rock nursing her child, fell off in her sleep, and
was found by one of the other peasants next morning still sleeping, with
her babe at her bosom, in a pool of water which had fallen during the
storm. The <i>curé</i> tells me that these people are mainly Bogomilites, remains
of an ancient sect once widely spread in Bosnia and identical with the Albigenses.’
I observe that Jireček, quoting Kosanović (Glasnik 29, (1871), 174),
alludes to a rumour that in the valley of the Narenta and near Creševo,
‘there are still Christians who neither submit to Franciscans, nor Popes,
nor Imâms, but govern themselves according to old traditions, which an
Elder delivers to the rest.’ I hope at some future period to be able to say
more on the present state of the Bogomiles.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_78" href="#FNanchor_78" class="label">[78]</a> See <a href="#Page_214">p. 214</a>. There seems, however, to be some discrepancy as to dates.
According to Schimek (op. cit. p. 76), Czar Dūshan only annexed Bosnia in
1347, whereas the date of the Armorial is 1340. The Ban, Stephen Kotromanović,
retained a small part of his dominions on the Hungarian frontier.
Dūshan placed the rest under the despot Lazar of Rascia. On Dūshan’s
death in 1355 the Ban recovered the whole of Bosnia, including a part of
Serbia beyond the Drina and the grave of St. Sava at Mileševo, where he
built a Franciscan Monastery, and where he himself was buried in 1357.</p>

extracts from some of the Servian <i>Pjesme</i> on this subject are translated by
Sir John Bowring in his <i>Servian Popular Poetry</i>. There is also an interesting
account of the battle in Knolles’ <i>Turkish History</i>, 1610, which shows
how great was already the poetic influence on the story. ‘The brightness of
the Armor and Weapons,’ writes our English historian, ‘was as it had been
the Lightning, the multitude of Launces and other horsemen’s staves shadowed
the light of the Sun. Arrows and darts fell so fast that a man would have
thought they had poured down from Heaven. The noise of the Instruments
of War, with the neighing of Horses and outcries of men was so terrible and
great that the wild Beasts of the mountains stood astonied therewith;
and the Turkish Histories, to express the terror of the day (vainly say) that
the Angels of Heaven amazed with that hideous noise for that time forgot
the heavenly hymns wherewith they always glorifie God.’ It is possible that
the thunder of cannon was now heard for the first time in the Balkan peninsula.

<p><a id="Footnote_117" href="#FNanchor_117" class="label">[117]</a> The Venetians at different times succeeded in extending their dominion
over parts of Herzegovina. The coast-land (<i>Primorie</i>), including Macarska,
Castelnuovo, &amp;c., passed definitely into their hands in the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries, to become at a later period the inheritance of Austria.
The Venetians at one time extended their suzerainty over the Popovo Polje,
Gacko and Piva. In 1694 their Proveditor-General in Dalmatia, Delfino,
took Gabella Citluk (Počitelj); and their general, Marcello, pursued the
Seraskier to Nevešinje. At this time the Christian inhabitants of the
districts of Trebinje, Popovo, Klobuć, and Grahovo (i.e. of much the same
area as that of the latest Herzegovinian outbreak) rose against the Pashàs and
Agas, and the Mussulman inhabitants. By the peace of Carlovitz in 1699
the Herzegovinian towns of Citluk, Gabella, Cattaro, Castelnuovo, and
Risano, with Knin and Zengg and other places, were left in the hands of the
Venetians; and the only remaining strips of Herzegovinian coast-land, the
narrow <i>enclaves</i> of Klek and Sutorina, were left to the Turks by English
influence and Ragusan precaution, which feared Venetian contact.</p>

the pious Thomas and his Queen was destroyed by the Turks, but the Franciscans
obtained permission to rebuild it, and set a great cross there, which

of which have been collected by Schimek, whose work—which professes to
be a political history of Bosnia—is absolutely silent as to the inner relations
of the province for the last two centuries of Bosnian history after the conquest,
which he professes to describe. A more confused and purposeless
tissue of wars and rumours of wars it is impossible to conceive. The difficulty
of obtaining trustworthy materials for the history of Bosnia after the
Turkish conquest has led me to confine my sketch of this period to a few

<p><a id="Footnote_143" href="#FNanchor_143" class="label">[143]</a> Ami Boué. In corroboration of this I may cite the testimony of an
English traveller, Edmund Spencer:—‘While attending the Parliamentary
debates of the Skuptchina, I was much struck with the self-possessed,
dignified air of the almost unlettered orators, who were earnest without
violence, impassioned without intemperance, depending rather on the force
of their arguments than the strength of their lungs and theatrical gesticulations,
to win the attention of their auditors. The Serbs resemble us in
more than one particular: they have the same dogged resolution, the same
love of fair play, the same detestation of the use of the knife, together with
no inconsiderable portion of that mixture of the aristocratic and democratic
in their character which so especially distinguishes the Anglo-Saxon race.’
The last remark is now peculiarly applicable to the Bosnian branch of the
Serbs.</p>

order, who discard the monastic dress and wear the ordinary civil costume,
including cutlasses and pistols. Every three years the chapter of the order
(the Provincial, that is, of the Minorites, with a custos and four definitors)
elects a ‘mission for the cure of souls,’ and the monks who are doing service
an secular priests are either confirmed in their office or exchanged for others.
The head or ‘Quardian’ of every monastery is also priest for his district.
Thus the parish churches are completely dependent on the Franciscan
brotherhood, each monastery possessing so many churches. This at Gučiagora
has nine; that at Sutiska, the largest in Bosnia, as many as twenty-two
churches. As parish priests, however, the brothers find their allegiance
somewhat divided between the Vicar Apostolic of Bosnia and the Provincial
of their order. See Thoemmel, <i>Beschreibung des Vilajet Bosnien</i>,

state of the Roman Catholic Church in Bosnia since the establishment
of the Austrian Consulate-General in Serajevo. Writing in 1867, he
says that in 1850 there were only forty-one parsonages in Bosnia, now sixty-nine.
Up to 1860 only the three old monasteries of Sutiska, Foinica, and
Kreševo existed; since then three more have been founded, namely this at
Gučiagora, one at Gorica, near Livno, and one at Siroki-brieg, in the Herzegovina,
six hours west of Mostar. In 1850 the Roman Catholic population
was 160,000, in 1874 it had risen to 185,503.</p>

when Mahomet subdued the Duchy of St. Sava, and quotes Varennes to
the effect that the original arms of Bosnia were an arm of offence—Varennes
himself having mistaken the arms of Primorie for those of Bosnia. The
Bosnian arms, however, appear to have changed. Thus, in a MS. armorial
in the Bodleian Library, the date of which seems to be about 1506, they are
given as—Quarterly, first and fourth, gules, a crown or; second and third,
azure, a heart argent. This may have been the arms of the <i>titulary</i> Kingdom
of Bosnia, erected by Mathias when Upper Bosnia was in the hands of
the Turks. Compare also the arms on the monumental slab of Queen Catharine

attack of Philip by the moon coming out and revealing the approach of the
enemy. See <i>Dalmatia</i>, &amp;c. vol. ii. p. 184. The Osmanlìs must have

is only levied on males between the ages of sixteen and sixty. In practice
it is levied on old men of eighty as well as infants in arms, and often
amounts to thirty piastres. A round sum is demanded from every village,
and the <i>Knez</i>, or Mayor, has to divide it as best he may; but the sum demanded
by the Government is always out of all proportion to the number
of those who are legally called on to pay it.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_247" href="#FNanchor_247" class="label">[247]</a> The tithe or ‘dime’ was converted into an eighth a few years ago,
(to pay the expense of the Sultan’s European tour), by the imposition of an
extra two-and-a-half per cent., which, by an artifice common to the thimble-rigging
financiers of Stamboul, was called ‘a temporary aid.’ Since the
revolt this aid has been given up by the <i>Iradè</i> of October 10, 1875.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_249" href="#FNanchor_249" class="label">[249]</a> To show that these and other tortures are by no means new in Bosnia,
I may be allowed to cite a curious passage from a book on Turkish <i>Manners
and Customs</i>, and having especial reference to the Turkish border-province
of Dalmatia, written in the sixteenth century by a citizen of Zara, Messer
Luigi Bassano, and entitled <i>I Costumi et i Modi particolari de la vita de
Turchi</i>. Roma, 1545. Ch. xxxiii. is headed ‘<i>Modo che usano d’impalare, e
d’altre sorti de Morti, e torture che danno</i>.’ After giving the most ghastly
details as to the method of impalement, and instancing the case of a certain
Capitan Lazero Albanese, who had been recently captured on the Dalmatian-Herzegovinian
frontier, and had suffered in this way, the writer continues:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘<i>Usano oltro l’impalare anchora l’inganciare sopra le forche, dove sono tre ganci fatti
à modo d’una falcetta da mietere il grano, ma grosse tanto che possin sostenere un’huomo,
e qui s’appiccha chi v’è condennato, e vi pende per molti giorne miserabilmente. Appicchano
anchora con una fune sottile e lunga, tal che l’appiccato tocca quasi terra co piedi, con tutto
che la forcha sia alta. Soglion’ anchora ligare l’huomo tra due tavole, e con quelle dal capo
dividerlo per il mezzo con una siega. Usano tormentare lardando, hor con pece hor con
lardo, metter celate rouide in testa, metter’i temperatoi sotto l’ungna, cacciare un’ asciugatoio,
di quei che loro usano da cingersi, bagnato d’aceto giu per la gola e retirarlo poi su à
poco à poco, e questo è un tormento crudelissimo. Sogliono tal’hora ligare un’huomo per un
piede nudo à una colonna, attorno la quale fanno assai buon fuoco, l’ultimo rimedio, poi
che il ligato è caldo, è di muoversi hor di la, hor di qua, ma poi che non puo piu, stanco e
sforzato mancare, e morire, arrostito e rosso, com’un Gambero.</i>’</p>

</div>

<p>Recent accounts of impalement in Bosnia have been received with incredulity
by a portion of the English public, and that although the Turkish
denials were absolutely worthless. For my own part I am credulous enough
to believe that the impaled figure seen by Canon Liddon and Mr. McColl
was not a scarecrow; and further, that Bishop Strossmayer was well-informed
in stating that this was by no means an isolated case. The recent
instances attested by Miss Irby’s friends now set the matter beyond dispute.
Impalement was common in Bosnia during the disturbed times
immediately preceding the Crimean war, and the supposition that a time-honoured
institution like this should in a few years’ time have died out in
the most conservative country in Europe, is, <i>à priori</i>, extremely improbable.
Barbarities like these are characteristic of a certain stage of society, and
need excite no surprise. Many of the tortures still practised in Bosnia are
an inheritance from præ-Turkish times, and should be considered in connection
with the general survival there of feudalism under a Mahometan guise.</p>

how a Bosnian landlord, a Beg, extorted money from six rayahs by suspending
them over a fire of maize-stalks. ‘<i>Les six raïas ne furent rendus la liberté
qu’à moitié asphyxiés, après que la douleur leur eut arraché la promesse de
donner tout ce qu’ils possédaient.</i>’ In the forthcoming work of Mr. Stillman,
the <i>Times’</i> correspondent, on the ‘Insurrection in the Herzegovina,’ the
reader will find (p. 9) an account of horrible instances of judicial torture
perpetrated on a rayah family near Trebinje, in the period immediately preceding
the revolt. Two were put in long wooden boxes like coffins and rolled
down hill: others were stood upright with their heads in a hole in the floor
of the prison which allowed them to rest on their shoulders, and splinters of
wood were then driven under their finger-nails.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_256" href="#FNanchor_256" class="label">[256]</a> Lest this account of the Fanariote Hierarchy, as it exists in Bosnia
should appear incredible to my readers, I may be allowed to appeal to Herr
Kanitz’s description of the spiritual rule of these same gentry in Bulgaria,
now happily terminated by the resolute action of their Bulgar flock. Herr
Kanitz, who is a most candid and impartial observer, and has the advantage
of twelve years’ residence in the country, finds no word for them but
Spiritual Pashàs. Four thousand ducats (2,000<i>l.</i>) was a tolerably cheap
price for a bishopric in Bulgaria, and the bishops, even of the poorest
dioceses, sucked as much as 1,500<i>l.</i> a year from their flocks. When the Porte
proposed the erection of school-houses for the Christians, the Fanariote Hierarchy
stood out against this liberal measure, and embezzled their educational
fund to build new churches in their usual swaggering style. ‘What
need have you of better schools?’ asked the Archbishop of Nish of his
congregation. ‘Do you want your children to become unbelieving heretics?’
True to their Grecizing policy, these Angels of Darkness burnt all the monuments
of old Bulgarian literature that they could lay hands on, and imposed
Greek services on congregations who could not understand a word.
Of their moral influence I will let Herr Kanitz speak—in German:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>‘<i>Die schlimmste Demoralisation wurde in directester Weise in die Familien hineingetragen.
Weder Frauen noch Jungfrauen waren vor den Gelüsten des höheren Klerus aus
dem Fanar sicher. Die dem Grossvezier im Jahre 1860 vorgebrachten Anklagen in allen
Städten, die er durchzog, überstiegen, was die Abscheulichkeit und Zahl betrifft, alle Begriffe.
Unter vielen Thatsachen sei hier nur erwähnt, dass der Griechische Bischof von Sarköi
von dem griechischen Arzte dieser Stadt beschuldigt wurde, 13- bis 14-jährige Mädchen
der dortigen Schule geschändet zu haben. Zu diesen Verheerungen in der Unmündigen
Jugend ihrer Sprengel gesellte sich ein anderer, nicht minder schwerer, sehr häufig gegen
die fanariotische Geistlichkeit erhobener Vorwurf: ihre Begünstigung des Kindesmordes
im Mutterschoosse.</i>’—Donau-Bulgarien und der Balkan, I. Band, p. 129.</p>

</div>

<p>Herr Jireček, in his recent <i>Geschichte der Bulgaren</i>, corroborates these facts,
and adds others even more gross (<i>see</i> p. 513). Brought to bay at last by the
sturdy opposition of the Bulgarian people, the Fanariote bishops got rid of
some of their principal opponents by poison. See Jireček, op. cit, p. 555.</p>

are in the habit of sending other searchers after the first, on the pretence of
finding out any trickery on the part of these, as if they were not all accomplices;

were the trophies of war with the Montenegrines, who adorned their
Vladika’s palace at Cettinje with the same barbarous spoil. The Bosnian
arms, with their impaled Moors’ heads, are perhaps a witness to the antiquity
of this practice in these countries. Sir Gardner Wilkinson tried to persuade
Ali Pashà to give up the practice, and even attempted a mutual agreement
between the Pashà and the Vladika on the subject, but Sir Gardner hardly
appreciated the character of the man with whom he was dealing. When
the author of <i>Dalmatia and Montenegro</i> visited Mostar he only saw five
heads on the palace, but as these were over the tower, there may have been
far more. The monk mentions that over 1,000 Christians were executed in
the Herzegovina under Ali Pashà’s government, and, during the same
space of time, only three Mahometans! Ali Pashà used also to impale
rayahs.</p>

eye, who, when pretty, frequently contrive to remove it “accidentally on

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_315" href="#FNanchor_315" class="label">[315]</a> I venture to assume an etymologic connexion between the Dalmatian
<i>Narbona</i> and the <i>Narbo Martius</i> of Southern Gaul. If we had not the
testimony of ancient writers to the fact that there was a Celtic ingredient
in ancient Illyria, we should surely be justified in assuming it from the
names of some of the cities. Orange seems to repeat itself in the Illyrian
<i>Arauso</i>; Anderida in Andretium; and Corinium gives us a Cirencester in
the neighbourhood of Zara. Epulus, the name of an Illyrian king, is
curiously suggestive of the Eppillus of British coins. This Narbona has
certain analogies of position with its Gallic homonym. Of course the ancient
name of the Narenta—<i>Naro</i>—is also connected with that of the city.
This city is called Narbona by both Ptolemy and Polybius, but accounts
of its origin differ. According to one it was a Phœnician colony; according
to others its founders were Phrygian or Thracian. The chief authority
on Narbona or Narona is Dr. Lanza, in his <i>Saggio storico-statistico-medico
sopra l’antica Città di Narona</i>, Bologna, 1842, which I only know through
the summary in Neigebaur’s <i>Süd-Slaven</i>. For the inscriptions of course
the Illyrian volume of the <i>Corpus Inscriptionum</i> is now the authority; but
in elucidating and first calling attention to these much credit is due to Dr.
Lanza, Major Sabljur, and Sir Gardner Wilkinson, who gives fac-similes of
thirty-three in his work on Dalmatia. Some Naronan inscriptions were
published at Ragusa, in 1811, in the <i>Marmora Macarensia</i>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_316" href="#FNanchor_316" class="label">[316]</a> Viddo seems to answer to the Vid or Vit in the Rügen deities Sviantovid,
Rugevit, and Porevit, in which names it is variously interpreted as
‘warrior’ or ‘sight,’ Sviantovid being ‘holy sight’ or ‘holy warrior.’ In
Illyria <i>Vid</i> means ‘sight.’ It is possible that this Vid is connected with
another Sclavonic god Woda, who has been compared with Woden.</p>

and Mr. A. A. Paton in his <i>Danube and Adriatic</i>, have given such excellent

<p><a id="Footnote_328" href="#FNanchor_328" class="label">[328]</a> Sir Gardner Wilkinson and others called it ‘oak-wood,’ forgetting that
<i>Dubrava</i> and <i>Dub</i> mean ‘oak-wood,’ and ‘oak’ only as their secondary
meaning, and primarily signify a wood and tree generally. Remains of the
original pine-wood still covered the mountain side till the French destroyed
it about the year 1806, when they swept away the freedom of the Republic.

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_329" href="#FNanchor_329" class="label">[329]</a> Alas! that I should have to record that the statue dates at least eight
centuries later than Orlando’s time. This statue, which originally stood
before the Church of S. Biagio, was thrown down in 1825 by a hurricane,
when the following inscription was found on a brass plate beneath its
pedestal: <span class="allsmcap">MCCCC.... III. DI MAGGIO ‖ FATTO NEL TEMPO DI PAPA MARTINO
QUINTO ‖ E NEL TEMPO DEL SIGNOR NOSTRO ‖ SIGISMONDO IMPERATOR

CROATIA ETC. FÒ MESSA ‖ QUESTA PIETRA ET STENDARDO QUI ‖ IN HONOR

interesting to notice that the Ragusan account of Orlando as ‘Governor
of Bretagne’ agrees with the contemporary Einhard’s account of the historical
Roland. The historian of Charles the Great calls him ‘Hruodlandus
Brittannici limitis præfectus.’ Orlando’s exploits are associated with other
towns of the eastern coast of the Adriatic. Sir Gardner Wilkinson mentions
that the magnificent harbour of Pola is called ‘Orlando’s house.’ The probable
design of the statue of Roland at Ragusa was, as in the free German
cities, to signify her independence of external authority.</p>

<p>‘A work which at the present time no intelligent Englishman can overlook.’</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">English Independent.</span></p>

<p>‘This is an opportune publication, of much interest at present in connection
with the Servian rising.’</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Nature.</span></p>

<p>‘Of this book we can say, as the author does of Ragusa, “it far surpasses
our most sanguine expectations.”’</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">The Academy.</span></p>

<p>‘One of the freshest, and most opportune, and instructive books of travel
that has been published for some time.’</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Examiner.</span></p>

<p>‘The numerous sketches and illustrations found throughout this volume help
to bring most vividly before the reader the costumes of the people and the aspect
of the country. <i>Through Bosnia and the Herzegovina</i> is a book which will well
repay reading.’</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">The Field.</span></p>

<p>‘This well-written, interesting, and seasonable book discusses the north-western
districts of Turkey in a scholarly and lucid style, with the pen of a
competent writer, to whom description is clearly no hard or irksome task, and who
displays judgment and original thought in the exercise of his literary calling.’</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Pall Mall Gazette.</span></p>

<p>‘In the present deplorable state of political affairs in the East, a book of
travels descriptive of two provinces of European Turkey, which are now in
rebellion against the sway of the Sultan, and written by an able and observant
eye-witness, has more than ordinary interest.... Throughout the book the
Author gives ample proof of a tourist endowed with quick observation and the
happy faculty of vividly reproducing what he sees and hears.... Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans’s</span>
book is very able, instructive, and readable; and students of history will gladly
make acquaintance with its lucid and interesting pages.’</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Morning Post.</span></p>

<p>‘This is a most opportune contribution to the geography, customs, and history
of a country which has suddenly emerged from the dimmest obscurity into the
full glare of European observation. A few months ago it would not have been
easy to find anyone who knew exactly where Bosnia, or even Servia, was situated,
or what was the character of their inhabitants, or the nature of their relation to
the Porte; and, though this ignorance has since been partially dispelled by the
pressing interest of the events that have happened there, and the still more
important issues to which these events are probably the prelude, we are still very
grateful to anyone who will enable us to see and understand these countries
more distinctly. This has been very effectively done for a single district by
Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>.... These are but samples of the curious information which is to
be gained from this book. It is, besides, extremely well written and very amusing,
and we confidently recommend it to all who desire to gain some knowledge, at
the present critical moment, of the outlying provinces of the dissolving Turkish
empire.’</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Guardian.</span></p>

<p>‘This is a most interesting volume, and its publication at the present time is
exceedingly opportune, as it gives information which may be relied on, accompanied
by excellent engravings and woodcuts, and may help to form a public sentiment
in England in reference to the war in the East, which it seems to us can only end
in the overthrow of the hateful Turkish power in Europe. The Author and his
brother had planned to visit these districts before the outbreak, from special
curiosity to see a race of Sclavonic Mahometans; and it was during their walk
through the country, under the protection of an autograph letter from the
Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief of the Turkish forces, that the
insurrection burst out into a flame. They travelled on foot, encamped in the
open air, in the forest or on the mountain, as necessity required, mingled with
the inhabitants in friendly and pleasant intercourse. They have recorded the
results of their visit in a form that may assist in the solution of difficult political
problems, interest those who take pleasure in foreign travel, and strengthen the
sympathy which, in free Protestant England, is gradually but steadily being
awakened by the stragglers for freedom in these unhappy countries.... A valuable
historical review of Bosnia is found at the beginning of the volume, which will
enable the reader to trace the political history of these lands through their many
changes and degradations to the present time. Truly the darkness that now
rests upon them is a darkness that may be felt, but the deepest darkness is that
which precedes the dawn.’</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Literary World.</span></p>

<p>‘Many volumes of travel have been published which profess to describe the
aspects of those South Slavonic lands in which the insurrection against the
Turkish power, has now for more than a year been aflame; but we have not
met with any that deserves to be compared with the book which lies before us.
Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span> combines a variety of qualities, every one of which contributed its
share to the excellence of his work, but which even taken singly are not too
commonly found among writers of travel, and in well-harmonised union are
still more rare. Sound scholarship, wide historical and archæological reading,
an intimate previous knowledge of other Slavonic populations, and an appreciation
of the peculiar merits of the Slavonic character prepared Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span> for
an investigation into the state and prospects of Bosnia, which was the more
valuable because it had been projected long before even the first outbreak in
Herzegovina, and was carried out without any idea that the troubled scenes
amid which it was conducted involved the large political issues subsequently
apparent. But, other travellers with similar advantages of knowledge and prepossession
might have missed the most important of Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans’s</span> observations.
To have passed through the Slavonic provinces of Turkey in a travelling carriage,
along the main roads, from city to city, and to have been the guest of Pashà
after Pashà, would have been the ordinary fate of the English traveller, and
such an experience would have revealed little or nothing of the character and
condition of the rayahs. Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span>, to the amazement of the Turkish officials,
and not a little to their embarrassment, made up his mind to penetrate across
the country on foot, and to see close at hand the common life of the Christian
peasants. In this purpose he persevered, in spite of the remonstrances and
menaces of puzzled and suspicious Turks, and his success has secured us a most
important mass of testimony bearing upon that phase of the Eastern Question
which Europe can no longer put aside. Moreover, a refined and educated taste
has enabled Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span> to reproduce, for the benefit of his readers, the sensations
of pleasure aroused by grand or tender scenery, by historical associations and
dim suggestions of antiquity, by those beauties of nature in tree and flower,
and even insect life that escape the careless eye. For Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans</span> is something
of a botanist and an entomologist as well as an antiquary and a scholar. He is
as ready to call our attention to interesting mountain forms, to the delicate
beauty of the flora, and to the moths and butterflies that revel among these
blossoms, as to a trace of Roman inheritance in the form of a jar, or to an
apposite allusion in Claudian or Ausonius. His style, it must be added, is
vigorous and well sustained, often pleasantly touched with humour, and sometimes
approaching to eloquence. Few indeed will take up Mr. <span class="smcap">Evans’s</span> volume
who will decline to read it through, and even those who feel no active curiosity
about Slavonic society, or who turn from the Eastern Question as an interminable
tangle of inconsistent theories, cannot refuse to interest themselves in this
record of travel through scenes that have now obtained for themselves a
permanent place in history.’</p>
